# Useful Infrastructure Commands

First things first. To start (and shutdown) the service stack, use these commands.

```
docker-compose -f <path-to-docker-compose.yml> up -d 	// starts up docker-compose service stack, -d = detached

docker-compose -f <path-to-docker-compose.yml> down	// shuts down docker-compose service stack
```

After starting up, you can check if all instances are running correctly using `docker ps`. 
There should be a container broker and zookeeper running.


Itâ€™s good practice to explicitly create them before using them, even if Kafka is configured to automagically create them when referenced.
Run this command to create a new topic

```
docker exec broker \
kafka-topics --bootstrap-server broker:9092 \
             --create \
             --topic <name-of-topic>
```
