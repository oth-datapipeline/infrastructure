Thorne, a former counterterrorism officer with the Wales Extremism and Counter Terrorism Unit, said he was shocked by what he saw in Scotland. “We left Scotland with a process that was not complete or adequate in any way,” he said.\n\nThe key issues highlighted during the test run reemerged right away, according to emails and internal memos from 2014 and 2015 reviewed by BuzzFeed News.\n\nOfficers described a system that was “crashing routinely” and “timing out after 10 minutes,” with glitches so severe that they dramatically increased “the time required to perform a simple task.”\n\nEven basic searches caused trouble. One officer had described how he put in a search term and received a result that was too broad. He started sifting through the documents manually to figure out which ones he actually needed — but as he did so, the system crashed. When he logged back in, he typed in the same search terms and found that “the search result was not the same.”\n\nOfficers using the new systems also reported serious difficulties with the very problem the NCIA was aiming to solve: communicating with other forces and agencies. After a suspicious person entered the UK by plane, an officer reported that they received an important intelligence report from officers at the airport in an unreadable format. Another told a member of the Apollo team that the NCIA’s inability to share intelligence with the other regions still using the old system was a critical risk that “may lead to intelligence failure.”\n\nThe quality of intelligence that did make it onto the system was often poor. In some cases, the NCIA was deluged with irrelevant information; in others, vital intelligence did not show up on the NCIA at all. One officer complained that the system “auto ingests” documents that had nothing to do with terrorism. “This issue was something that was always talked about,” the officer wrote, “however now we are live there appears to have been nothing more done about it.”\n\nThe NCIA was built on the template of an already existing system called the Home Office Large Major Enquiry System, four sources told BuzzFeed News. The problem, one said, is that HOLMES is used to investigate incidents that have already occurred whereas the NCIA is intended to prevent attacks from happening. Another officer told BuzzFeed News that building the NCIA on top of the HOLMES system caused defects that left large amounts of intelligence difficult to find.\n\nOfficers echoed these concerns in their emails and official reports. One of the key features borrowed from the HOLMES system was a search tool, much like Google, that was supposed to enable officers to quickly retrieve documents containing a certain word, regardless of where on the record the particular word appeared. If it worked, this would make it far easier to find specific intelligence on potential terrorists from hundreds of thousands of files.\n\nBut the search tool wasn’t working. Officers found that if they put in the same search term on multiple occasions, they would often get a different result each time. The search tool also wasn’t able to scan for dates of birth, making it much harder to pinpoint the right document.\n\nThis shortcoming dovetailed with another major problem. Early on, it became clear that many duplicated records would make their way onto the NCIA — since it was compiling data from multiple forces that often possessed the same file on a given individual. One internal report seen by BuzzFeed News acknowledges that this would cause a “knock on” effect that hampered analysts. But higher-ups ultimately decided that “no de-duplication would occur” until the entire UK was using the NCIA.\n\nOne Manchester-based officer who later started using the NCIA told BuzzFeed News that duplications made finding what you were looking for like “trying to find a needle in a haystack” — such a struggle that “you could miss vital intelligence leads.”\n\nThorne, the counterterror detective who worked on the NCIA, was growing increasingly concerned. “Unfortunately,” he wrote to colleagues in a February 2014 email, “as we are all fully aware the NCIA has struggled to deliver what was promised and has not been fit for purpose.”\n\nThe rollout of the NCIA pressed ahead.","source":null},{"_id":{"$oid":"625c4dc0ceb2b567b3df84c9"},"feed_source":"BuzzFeed News","title":"Russia Has Banned Facebook And Instagram After Labeling Meta's Activities “Extremist\"","link":"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/christopherm51/russia-facebook-instagram-ban-extremist-organization","published":"Tue, 22 Mar 2022 22:54:46 -0400","author":"Christopher Miller","summary":"A Russian court has banned the use of Facebook and Instagram after labeling the activities of the apps’ parent company Meta as “extremist,” according to the state-run RIA Novosti news agency.\nIndividuals will not face criminal charges for using Facebook or Instagram.\n\"The use of Meta's products by individuals and legal entities should not be considered as participation in extremist activities,\" a spokesperson for the prosecutor's office told state media outlet TASS.\n“This is a public demonstration of the symbols of an extremist organization,” the organization said.\nOther American tech companies, including Google and Apple, have similarly responded to the invasion by blocking access to Russian state media.","published_parsed":[2022,3,23,2,54,46,2,82,0],"authors":[{"name":"Christopher Miller"}],"tags":["prosecutors","state","metas","banned","organization","labeling","activities","meta","media","russia","instagram","russian","facebook","extremist"],"comments":null,"content":"A Russian court has banned the use of Facebook and Instagram after labeling the activities of the apps’ parent company Meta as “extremist,” according to the state-run RIA Novosti news agency.\n\nThe move came after the Russian prosecutor general’s office appealed to the Moscow court for Meta to be designated an “extremist organization” for allowing users in some countries to call for violence against President Vladimir Putin and Russian soldiers participating in the country’s invasion of Ukraine.

His verses are constructed of modern contradictions (“stunning 8K resolution meditation app”) and phrases that at face value are absurd (“the live-action Lion King”), while the chorus once again contends with the titular feeling. Except Burnham does not name the feeling. Instead, he evokes a general notion that something is off. The song doesn’t work if the idea of a “stunning 8K resolution meditation app” doesn’t arouse something similar in you, too. It’s vaguely dystopian, disoriented, unmoored.\n\nBurnham and I are roughly the same age. I was 1 when the Berlin Wall fell. I was 3 by the time the Soviet Union collapsed. Burnham and I are in the middle range of millennials, a generation born into the longest period of global American supremacy, and we’ve been deeply shaped by this stretch. In the West, it’s been understood as an era of stability; in the early 1990s, one political scientist even suggested we’ve arrived at the “end of history,” an argument that, following the triumph of Western liberal democracies over other arrangements of governments, there would be no going back. And so it was for most of my life that history has been over. The general edicts of the rules-based order and liberal society have applied. The world was now unipolar, the US became the central axis around which the world spun. American wars no longer had specific ideological enemies; instead, they were fought against concepts — public opinion was mobilized to engage in a war on “terror.” Two years before I was born, in the spring of 1986, German sociologist Ulrich Beck published the book Risk Society. Beck’s ambitions were high. He was grasping for a unifying theory, trying to name an ethos of anxiety and uncertainty, a pervasive vagueness of the age we were in. In the preface, he declares that he takes issue with the “post-” prefix; at the time, everything was “post-” — postwar, postindustrial, postmodern, postcolonial. Beck was unsatisfied with that frame because “post-” is a negative definition. It defines what something is not. That we are “postmodern” tells you very little about what has replaced modernity. Beck argued that we were actually in a “risk” society — a very cool, not-at-all-alarming name — an era of organizing ourselves in response to global, anonymous, invisible threats. But Beck didn’t stop at naming it — he offered a way forward: a framework for how to live in a risk society. His fundamental question: “How can we cope with the fear, if we cannot overcome the causes of the fear? How can we live on the volcano of civilization without deliberately forgetting about it, but also without suffocating on the fears — and not just on the vapors that the volcano exudes?” We have arrived at the mouth of the volcano. Two years after the start of a global pandemic that has killed millions around the world and nearly a million in the US and upended the lives of everyone on the planet, we find ourselves at a crossroads at every level of our lives. On a personal level, our friendships have been reordered. On a national level, technology has accelerated a complete breakdown in trust of institutions that once served to keep us together. Globally, a war in Ukraine has exposed the fragility of the rules-based order. Meanwhile, the collective reluctant action to fight the climate crisis has deepened instability and thrown into doubt the idea that we can avoid dire consequences. We are undergoing a colossal vibe shift that extends beyond taste, aesthetics, politics, fashion, or policy. The world as we knew it is not coming back, and it’s entirely reasonable that we may find ourselves plagued with a general restlessness, a vague notion of disorder. It’s that funny feeling.\n\nFuture Publishing via Getty Images Men clap for frontline workers in London in 2020.\n\nThey may have been days of anxiety and restlessness, but the early days of the pandemic were also a time of togetherness. This went beyond a performative online unity. There was a general sense that we were all vulnerable to a virus we still knew little about. Global economic machinery, for the most part, had ground to a halt. City streets were empty, save for the essential workers in hospitals, grocery stores, and other services required for survival. To let them know we appreciated the risk they were taking, many of us gathered on balconies and on sidewalks every night to bang on pots and pans as a chaotic expression of gratitude. On social media and in news articles, experts told us to take care of ourselves, to check on each other, and not to let the social bonds fray. People held “Zoom parties” as a consolatory replacement for the real thing. We may be apart, we declared, but we’ll find a way back to each other. Beloved musicians asked for patience and promised, “There will be light after dark / Someday when we aren’t 6 feet apart.” Actors, uh, tried to reassure us. But as the pandemic wore on, and waves crested and waned, a new set of politics started to emerge: the politics of risk. Many of us found ourselves gravitating toward friends who shared the same risk tolerance as us. Alliances formed based on how willing people were to spend time with each other IRL or how willing they were to maintain a digital relationship. Friendships weakened over differing ideas of what constitutes an acceptable hangout in the time of COVID-19. On a deeper level, the pandemic has introduced an elevated tenor of personal politics. In this way, the pandemic enlarged politics, making it the most immediate thing about relationships. This process, which was certainly underway long before COVID — quite visibly so during the Trump presidency — has become even more acute as a willingness to follow health requirements became a kind of litmus test for friendship eligibility.\n\nBrent Stirton / Getty Images Trump supporters in Washington, DC, Jan. 6, 2021\n\nIf the personal level of our lives is filled with fraying personal relationships, the national level is filled with decay. Consider the corrosive pretext of Donald Trump’s entire argument. He never said that the people in power are corrupt and that he should lead instead; that would, at the very least, be an argument for preserving the integrity of the institutions. No, instead, Trump’s core offer was that the very institutions he sought to lead were themselves unworthy of redemption. “Drain the swamp” was not a promise to purify; it was a promise to undo.\n\nThe world as we knew it is not coming back, and it’s entirely reasonable that we may find ourselves plagued with a general restlessness.\n\n\n\nOn the one hand, it’s a deeply cynical, destructive, and indeed existential argument. On the other hand, a lot of people bought it. The good news is that Trump is not currently president. The bad news is that on his way out, he dealt a near-fatal blow to those institutions when he encouraged supporters to “fight like hell” and march on the Capitol. Sure, the system held up and rebuffed Trump’s play. But the cost was deep disarray, a rattled political realm that has not yet fully contended with the image of one president tarnishing the system. In a democracy governed by unwritten norms, adding a dangerous precedent is one of the most destabilizing things you can do. And who knows who will be compelled to push the precedent further next time? The more immediate question for American democracy is: Why did more people vote for Donald Trump in 2020 than in 2016? Surely they didn’t miss the news cycle of his entire presidency. It’s impossible to have missed him systematically subverting the institutions that governments rely on. So could it be that they bought the story that the institutions were unworthy of redemption? Did his presidency confirm something about decay in general social trust? Consider the Edelman Trust Barometer. The public relations firm has been conducting an annual global survey measuring public confidence in institutions since 2000. Its 2022 report, which found that distrust is now “society’s default emotion,” recorded a trend of collapsing faith in institutions such as government or media. Though it’s easy to be dismissive of Trump’s crass nihilist threat, it’s far harder to contend with the realities that enabled him to succeed. After decades of letting inequality worsen, those with their hands on the levers of American democracy suddenly found the will and drive to send thousands of dollars into the bank accounts of every American. US households grew their wealth by $13.5 trillion in 2020 thanks in part to generous government spending to keep the economy afloat. This may solve one big problem — how people were supposed to pay their rent and mortgages while work was closed — but it introduced a new one: Wait, so the government could’ve done this any time it wanted? Soon it became clear that even the wealth gains of the pandemic were not equal. Because of an unexpected stock market boom, ​​more than 70% of the increase in household wealth went to the top 20% of income earners. Generally, workers with higher incomes saw their lot improve due to the sweeping economic changes of COVID. Meanwhile, temporary pandemic aid programs helped reduce child poverty in the US before they were pulled back in late 2021. It’s possible — at times rational, even — to conclude that successive American governments have not considered widening income inequality to be an urgent problem. It’s rational to conclude that successive American governments have been asleep at the wheel, content with general economic growth while not paying attention to where that growth was going. That we have social language for this is a meaningful success of the Occupy Wall Street movement of 2011. Its physical impact may have been short, but its rhetorical one is a reimagination of the public language of inequality. We have a 1 percent and a 99 percent — and by every imaginable metric, the lives of the 1 percent have been getting better, even during a global pandemic. Indeed, the richest Americans have gotten unimaginably richer during this period of great upheaval. If there is comfort to be found in the vague promises to use the pandemic as an opportunity to rethink society — the vows for a “Great Reset,” the pledges to “Build Back Better” — the comfort is immediately undone by the reality that those very vows have been hijacked by anti-science, anti-vaccine, anti-lockdown people to claim baseless conspiracy theories that go as far as suggesting the lockdowns are deliberately designed to speed up economic collapse. These claims are not unique to the US. There have been tremors in Canada, where a convoy of truckers and their supporters occupied downtown Ottawa for weeks and demanded the prime minister’s removal. On the other side of the Atlantic, they’ve popped up in the Netherlands, Germany, and France. It’s difficult to imagine how trust in national governments can be repaired. This is not, on the face of it, apocalyptic. The lights are on and the trains run on time, for the most part. But civic trust, the stuff of nation-building, believing that governments are capable of improving one’s life, seems to have dimmed. In February, the Republican Party declared that the Jan. 6 insurrection and the preceding events that led to it constituted “legitimate political discourse.” At best, this is a direct attempt to minimize the events of that day. At worst, the Republicans’ declaration implies that the US’s political institutions are fraudulent and that any form of protest — including insurrection — is valid. This may get the party votes in the upcoming midterm elections, but it’ll cost more than money: It’ll come at the price of further deterioration in public trust.\n\nAnadolu Agency / Anadolu Agency via Getty Images Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky virtually addresses the US Congress from Kyiv on March 16, 2022.\n\nFor months, US intelligence had been claiming that Russia intended to invade Ukraine. That the intelligence was right is heartening. But it also raises another question: Why didn’t the US do anything to stop it? America still prides itself on being the moral compass of the world, the keeper of the liberal order. Why didn’t it move to act? Why didn’t we rally NATO and its allies to action? One thing we can deduce from the lack of action is that the plan, probably, was never to stop Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. President Joe Biden had long talked up his plan of targeted sanctions and diplomatic pressure. To put it another way, perhaps the US and NATO were going to let Ukraine fall and figure out what to do afterward. Then Ukrainians started pushing back. In a deeply rousing display of resistance, Ukrainians — led by a charismatic and direct president — made the case that they want to join the global liberal dream they’d heard so much about. Far from folding in front of Russian military might, Ukraine’s people used social media to tell a coherent and deeply moving story of national identity. In essence, ordinary Ukrainians used the argument of Westernization as a weapon: Here we are, displaying the very values you preach and claim to defend — freedom, openness, transparency, and national pride — so will you come to defend us? But in making the plea, Ukraine exposed a problem with the West. In the 30 years since the fall of the Soviet Union — nearly my entire lifetime — liberalism has come to be taken for granted, the will to defend it withered. Three decades of not articulating what you stand for will do that.\n\nLiberalism has come to be taken for granted, the will to defend it withered.\n\nMeanwhile, Russia has spent years pointing out that the neat story America tells has actually been a lie. The West, so secure in its superior narrative and assuredness that history has ended, has regularly defied some of its own fundamental tenets. It has repeatedly violated state sovereignty (see: the Iraq War). It has overlooked certain crises (see: Palestine) in favor of strategic interests. And it has preached the transformative power of free trade while simultaneously cooking up extraordinary sanctions (see: Venezuela, Iran). All in all, the US may have claimed moral superiority, but Russia needn’t reach far to poke holes in it. So now the rules-based order stands blemished, facing accusations of hypocrisy from its foes and disappointment from those who saw it as a beacon of hope. If liberalism stands for defending freedom everywhere, it sure isn’t eager to show it. The immediate consequence of this is another protracted war with no end in sight. The medium term carries uncertainty and danger. It turns out that not only are the bad guys not gone, they may even be winning. Some parts of the West do not have the luxury of feeling distance from danger. In the long term, the aftermath of the war in Ukraine means we can no longer tell ourselves the idealistic story that has only barely held up for the last 30 years. The rules-based order that I’ve understood to be central to the world has been revealed to be ineffectual and incapable of fulfilling its promise.","source":null},{"_id":{"$oid":"625c4dc1ceb2b567b3df84cb"},"feed_source":"BuzzFeed News","title":"Russian Oligarch Roman Abramovich Invested At Least $1.3 Billion With US Financiers, Secret Records Show","link":"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/tomwarren/roman-abramovich-billion-invested-united-states-financiers","published":"Wed, 16 Mar 2022 17:38:25 -0400","author":"Scott Pham","summary":"Between 2001 and 2016, a secretive network of 10 offshore companies plunged a whopping $1.3 billion into American investment firms and hedge funds.\nBut with the help of confidential banking records, investigators at State Street, one of America’s oldest banks, stumbled upon the identity of the mystery investor: Roman Abramovich, the oligarch famous for his ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin.\nThe investigators reported Abramovich’s investment network in a series of “suspicious activity reports” to the US Treasury Department in 2015 and 2016.\nThe US has not made any moves against Abramovich — but that may soon change, a US official told BuzzFeed News.\nThe State Street investigation shows that Abramovich had invested as much as 10% of his estimated wealth into funds managed by American financiers.","published_parsed":[2022,3,16,21,38,25,2,75,0],"authors":[{"name":"Tom Warren"},{"name":"Jason Leopold"},{"name":"Anthony Cormier"},{"name":"John Templon"},{"name":"Scott Pham"}],"tags":["money","state","firms","fincen","abramovich","invested","roman","street","13","investigators","billion","reports","russia","oligarchs","network"],"comments":null,"content":"Between 2001 and 2016, a secretive network of 10 offshore companies plunged a whopping $1.3 billion into American investment firms and hedge funds.\n\nThe money, sent through the high-secrecy jurisdictions of the British Virgin Islands and Cyprus, was difficult to trace. But with the help of confidential banking records, investigators at State Street, one of America’s oldest banks, stumbled upon the identity of the mystery investor: Roman Abramovich, the oligarch famous for his ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nThe investigators reported Abramovich’s investment network in a series of “suspicious activity reports” to the US Treasury Department in 2015 and 2016.\n\nThey pointed to court records showing that Abramovich had made “substantial cash payments” in Russia for “political patronage and influence.” And they detailed how the corporate structures of the companies holding the $1.3 billion had frequently changed, which they said could be an attempt to “conceal ownership.”\n\nDuring the next six years, the US government took no action against Abramovich, and the State Street investigation stayed secret.\n\nSince Russia invaded Ukraine in February, Western governments have moved to clamp down on oligarchs with ties to the Kremlin. Last week the United Kingdom sanctioned Abramovich, citing his “close relationship” with Putin and saying that materials from a steel company he controls may have been used to build Russian tanks. The UK froze his assets in the country, including several mansions and the Premier League soccer team Chelsea Football Club.\n\nThe US has not made any moves against Abramovich — but that may soon change, a US official told BuzzFeed News. Abramovich is under scrutiny by a new Justice Department–led task force called KleptoCapture, which aims to identify the wealth and freeze the assets of oligarchs who have aided Putin, the official said.\n\nHow much of Abramovich’s money made its way into the United States has never been publicly disclosed. The State Street investigation shows that Abramovich had invested as much as 10% of his estimated wealth into funds managed by American financiers.\n\nRepresentatives for Abramovich did not respond to repeated requests for comment.\n\nThe State Street episode, reported here for the first time, is based on the FinCEN Files, secret government documents obtained by BuzzFeed News and shared with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists.\n\nBanks and other financial institutions send suspicious activity reports to the Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, known as FinCEN, when they spot a transaction that bears the hallmarks of money laundering or other financial misconduct. The reports are not evidence of a crime, but can be useful tools for law enforcement agents.\n\nBuzzFeed News obtained thousands of these documents, which are never supposed to be made public, from Natalie Mayflower Sours Edwards, a whistleblower who worked at FinCEN. The Abramovich documents offer a hint of how much US investigators know about his holdings — and raise questions whether the government holds similar information about other oligarchs close to Putin.\n\nAbramovich has long been an object of controversy. In the turbulent 1990s, as Russia transitioned from Soviet communism to cartel capitalism, he made billions snapping up state energy companies on the cheap in rigged deals as they were privatized. Abramovich’s own lawyer has accepted in a British court that Abramovich was privy to corruption during this time.\n\nThis did not prevent him from receiving a warm welcome in the West — especially the UK. In the early 2000s, he bought Chelsea Football Club, as well as a swath of luxury properties in London’s upscale West End. He was such a fixture of “Londongrad” — the nickname for a city famed for its open welcome of oligarchs — that he was even parodied in a Guy Ritchie film.\n\nIn mainland Europe, Abramovich had other luxury properties, including a mansion on the French Riviera once inhabited by King Edward, who abdicated from the British throne in 1936. The oligarch’s yachts were frequently moored in the Mediterranean.","source":null},{"_id":{"$oid":"625c4dc1ceb2b567b3df84cc"},"feed_source":"BuzzFeed News","title":"“It’s Now Or Never”: The Next Three Years Are Crucial To Preventing The Worst Impacts Of Climate Change","link":"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/zahrahirji/climate-change-report-warning-ipcc","published":"Mon, 04 Apr 2022 17:13:59 -0400","author":"Zahra Hirji","summary":"The best possible future — the one with fewer climate disasters, extinctions, and human suffering — involves limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.\n“We are on a fast track to climate disaster,” United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres said on Monday while announcing the new report by the United Nation’s preeminent climate body, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\n“Without immediate and deep emissions reductions across all sectors, it will be impossible.”Skea was one of the hundreds of scientists worldwide who contributed to the report called “Climate Change 2022: Mitigation of Climate Change,” the third and final installment of the IPCC’s Sixth Climate Assessment.\n\"Climate change is the result of more than a century of unsustainable energy and land use, lifestyles and patterns of consumption and production,\" Skea said.\nIn the worst case, interests to mitigate climate change will be challenged because of this development.”","published_parsed":[2022,4,4,21,13,59,0,94,0],"authors":[{"name":"Zahra Hirji"}],"tags":["15","climate","global","change","celsius","fighting","degrees","report","warming","say","emissions","energy","crucial","scientists"],"comments":null,"content":"The best possible future — the one with fewer climate disasters, extinctions, and human suffering — involves limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. But for this to happen, a new report warns, greenhouse gas levels must start dropping by 2025.\n\n\n\n“We are on a fast track to climate disaster,” United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres said on Monday while announcing the new report by the United Nation’s preeminent climate body, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\n\n“This is not fiction or exaggeration,” he added. “It is what science tells us will result from our current energy policies. We are on a pathway to global warming of more than double 1.5 degrees.”\n\nIn 2016, practically every country signed the Paris climate agreement pledging to stave off the worst climate impacts by limiting global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius, ideally to 1.5 degrees Celsius, compared to preindustrial levels. But the world has already warmed 1.1 degrees Celsius, and this new report makes abundantly clear that the warmer temperature goals could soon be out of reach if humans don’t immediately and radically change how they live, from how they get energy and food to how they build and move around.\n\n“It’s now or never, if we want to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit),” Imperial College London’s Jim Skea, one of the report co-authors, said in a statement. “Without immediate and deep emissions reductions across all sectors, it will be impossible.”\n\nSkea was one of the hundreds of scientists worldwide who contributed to the report called “Climate Change 2022: Mitigation of Climate Change,” the third and final installment of the IPCC’s Sixth Climate Assessment. The previous installments, published in recent months, focused on summarizing the climate impacts already here and what’s possibly to come, as well as listing ways to adapt to these impacts.\n\nIn the face of ever-worsening climate impacts, from intensifying heat waves and floods to growing food disruptions, humans have spent the past decade adding fuel to the fire by continuing to spew more carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere than ever before.\n\nGlobal average emissions measured roughly 59 gigatons of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2019, about 12% higher than levels in 2010 and 54% higher than in 1990, per the new report. This is a staggering increase.\n\nBut the blame for rising emissions does not fall on everyone equally.\n\n“The 10% of households with the highest per capita emissions contribute a disproportionately large share of global [greenhouse gas] emissions,” according to a summary of the new report. For example, in 2019, Small Island Developing States are estimated to have released 0.6% of global greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n\n\nThe only way to prevent widespread climate damage is to immediately stop this trend. To keep the 1.5 degree Celsius future alive, per the report, people worldwide must collectively peak their emissions by 2025 and then reduce emissions 43% by 2030. Crucially, this involves cutting emissions of the potent greenhouse gas methane by 34% by 2030.\n\n\n\nFinally, by 2050, people must achieve net zero emissions, which is when they are releasing into the atmosphere the same levels of emissions they are pulling out of it.\n\nEven if all these deadlines are hit, scientists warn it’s still likely global average temperatures will temporarily exceed, or “overshoot,” 1.5 degrees Celsius, before returning below that level by the end of the century.\n\nKeeping even the 2.0 degree Celsius future in reach involves peaking global emissions by 2025, according to the report, then reducing emissions 27% by 2030, and achieving net zero emissions by the early 2070s.\n\nPerhaps the single biggest way to cut emissions is quickly transitioning away from fossil fuels to renewable and other alternative forms of energy. Limiting warming to 1.5 degrees, climate modeling suggests, involves cutting global use of coal, oil, and gas in 2050 by roughly 95%, 60%, and 45% compared to 2019 levels.\n\n\"Climate change is the result of more than a century of unsustainable energy and land use, lifestyles and patterns of consumption and production,\" Skea said. \"This report shows how taking action now can move us towards a fairer, more sustainable world.\"\n\nThe report’s release comes as Russia’s war in Ukraine has triggered spiking energy costs and, likewise, conversations in Europe, the United States, and elsewhere more quickly transitioning away from Russian fossil fuels.\n\n“We are, at the moment, facing challenging times. We have learned about this brutal war in Ukraine,” said Petteri Taalas, Secretary-General of the World Meteorological Organization, at the Monday news conference, before connecting the fighting on the ground to the fight to limit climate change. “In the best case, this would speed up the reduction of the use of fossil energy and also speed up the green transition. In the worst case, interests to mitigate climate change will be challenged because of this development.”","source":null},{"_id":{"$oid":"625c4dc2ceb2b567b3df84cd"},"feed_source":"BuzzFeed News","title":"A Staffer Crashed Russia's Main Evening Newscast With An Anti-War Sign","link":"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/davidmack/russian-tv-employee-anti-war-protest-live","published":"Tue, 15 Mar 2022 17:12:15 -0400","author":"David Mack","summary":"Viewers tuning into Russia's main evening news broadcast live on Monday night were briefly treated to the sight of something unscripted and which the Kremlin has desperately been trying to hide from them: an anti-war protest.\nAs newsreader Ekaterina Andreeva introduced a story on the program Vremya, or \"Time,\" which has aired for decades on the state-run Channel One Russia, another woman suddenly appeared behind her.\nNo to war!” the woman shouted.\nClutching a cardboard sign that featured the Russian and Ukrainian flags, the woman made sure people watching at home could read the words imprinted on it: \"Stop the war.\nThe camera then cut off as a prerecorded segment began airing.","published_parsed":[2022,3,15,21,12,15,1,74,0],"authors":[{"name":"David Mack"}],"tags":["russias","evening","unscripted","vremya","watching","tuning","viewers","war","crashed","woman","ukrainian","youthe","main","antiwar","newscast","words","sign","staffer"],"comments":null,"content":"Viewers tuning into Russia's main evening news broadcast live on Monday night were briefly treated to the sight of something unscripted and which the Kremlin has desperately been trying to hide from them: an anti-war protest.\n\nAs newsreader Ekaterina Andreeva introduced a story on the program Vremya, or \"Time,\" which has aired for decades on the state-run Channel One Russia, another woman suddenly appeared behind her.\n\n\"Stop the war!

The effort, which is ongoing, is known internally as “Project Texas.” According to seven current and former TikTok employees, it represents the company’s response to concerns from regulators that the Chinese government could use the app, owned by the Chinese corporation ByteDance, to access sensitive information about US citizens.\n\nThe heart of Project Texas has been the creation of US-specific clones of TikTok’s internal systems. Some of these systems are tracking and analytics tools, like the ones that employees use to monitor content virality, while others affect what users see, like the recommendation algorithm that powers TikTok’s popular “For You” page. The new US-specific systems, including all US user data, will be hosted in data centers owned by Oracle, TikTok’s “trusted technology partner.” (The project name is a nod to Oracle’s headquarters in Austin.) New controls will restrict access to the systems to a new US-based team, called US Tech Services (USTS). Once Project Texas is complete, TikTok plans to replicate it in Europe.\n\nOne critical part of Project Texas has not yet been decided: how much control Beijing will have over the USTS team. Today, USTS employees report to middle managers in the United States, who report to a ByteDance executive in China. But the company is discussing legal models to restrict Chinese managers’ access to USTS information, according to two people familiar with the discussions.\n\nTikTok declined to answer a detailed set of questions from BuzzFeed News about Project Texas. Company spokesperson Maureen Shanahan instead offered a statement: “TikTok is committed to protecting the privacy and security of our community. User data is stored in data centers in the US and Singapore, and we continue to invest in data security as part of our overall work to keep our users and their information safe.”\n\nShanahan declined to comment on TikTok’s discussions about creating a separate data governance entity, and on the fact that the USTS team reports to a ByteDance employee.\n\nProject Texas comes at a critical time in TikTok’s short history. TikTok was the world’s most-visited website in 2021, overtaking YouTube in US watch time and Facebook in app downloads for the first time. (Disclosure: In a previous life, I held policy positions at Facebook and Spotify.) But ever since TikTok became popular in the US, it has been fighting the perception that its Chinese ownership makes it dangerous. In 2019, the Committee for Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) began investigating whether TikTok posed a risk to national security, and the US Navy and Army banned TikTok from soldiers’ work phones. In August 2020, President Donald Trump announced that he would ban the app if it was not sold to a US company. As US tech giants Oracle and Microsoft explored a deal to buy TikTok from ByteDance, the Chinese government reclassified TikTok’s algorithm as a “sensitive technology” potentially ineligible for sale to a US company.\n\nDespite this complication, a tentative deal was reached between Oracle and ByteDance, but the sale was put on hold in February 2021 after Trump left office. Reuters earlier reported that TikTok and Oracle are nearing a deal for the US tech company to store all American user data, and that access to that data would be limited to a specific team. The Biden administration is currently in the process of developing new regulations for apps that could enable foreign governments to obtain US citizen data.\n\nSenator Marsha Blackburn, however, said she will be concerned as long as \"product developers and key decision makers are based out of the PRC. TikTok is saying what they think will help them escape scrutiny from lawmakers, but that won't happen as long as they remain the arm of the CCP.\"\n\n\n\nFears that China could use TikTok to access US citizens’ data or shape US civic discourse are not unfounded. In 2019, the Guardian reported that TikTok had censored videos on topics of Chinese political importance. TikTok had nearly 40 million US users at the time.

Some immigrants are quickly expelled to Mexico, and others are flown back to their home countries. President Joe Biden has continued to enforce the policy during court challenges, expelling people at the border more than 1 million times in the process.\n\nBut a pair of court rulings — including one in which a judge ordered the continuation of immigrant children being turned back at the border — along with an already evolving federal response to the pandemic within the US could spell the end of the policy. One senior DHS official told BuzzFeed News that the agency has been planning for the end of Title 42. And the draft document obtained by BuzzFeed News also references the department’s ongoing “contingency planning” for when it happens. On Wednesday, Reuters also reported that the administration was “leaning” toward ending Title 42.\n\nIn the meantime, DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas is expected to meet with Mexican officials next week.\n\nDHS officials in particular planned to stress to Mexico that if Title 42 is no longer in place, the agency will need to return to processing immigrants who cross the border without authorization through normal, pre-COVID practices, which would allow them to seek asylum and protection within the US. Prior to Title 42, immigrants apprehended at the border could apply for asylum and their claims were evaluated to determine if they could remain in the country to pursue their cases.\n\nBut those prepandemic practices could “seriously strain” border resources and lead to a challenging humanitarian situation in northern Mexico, the draft DHS document warns. Department officials also express concern about “historically and unseasonably high” numbers of immigrants crossing the border without authorization.\n\nThe use of Title 42 has given the Biden administration more than a year to consider changes to border policies and the asylum system. But whether any major changes will be in place when Title 42 goes away remains to be seen. Administration officials have been keen to implement a plan to dramatically reshape how asylum-seekers are processed in order to address a massive backlog of immigration court cases, potentially cutting the wait period for some applicants by years. The plan, which has yet to be released in its final version, would shift the decision-making power for whether certain immigrants encountered at the border are granted asylum from an immigration judge to an asylum officer.","source":null},{"_id":{"$oid":"625c4dc7ceb2b567b3df84d5"},"feed_source":"BuzzFeed News","title":"The War In Ukraine Exposes The World's Utter Reliance On Fossil Fuels","link":"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/zahrahirji/russia-ukraine-war-fossil-fuels-climate-change","published":"Fri, 11 Mar 2022 00:06:07 -0500","author":"Dan Vergano","summary":"This shift is most apparent in Europe, which is heavily reliant on imported Russian energy to keep the lights and heat on and has been experiencing a steady rise in energy prices.\nBut even with vast fossil fuel production at home, the US is not immune to the dramatic fluctuations in energy prices set by global energy markets.\nAs of Thursday, gas prices hit a national average of $4.31 a gallon (adjusted for inflation, the record price for gas was $5.53 a gallon, set in 2008).\nBiden’s solution to preventing this problem from recurring is the same as Europe’s: embracing clean energy.\n“It should motivate us to accelerate the transition to clean energy.”","published_parsed":[2022,3,11,5,6,7,4,70,0],"authors":[{"name":"Zahra Hirji"},{"name":"Dan Vergano"}],"tags":["supply","european","biden","war","worlds","ukraine","utter","fuels","reliance","fossil","exposes","energy","gas","russian","clean","transition","prices"],"comments":null,"content":"This shift is most apparent in Europe, which is heavily reliant on imported Russian energy to keep the lights and heat on and has been experiencing a steady rise in energy prices. The new conflict, and the escalating sanctions and scrapped pipeline plans in response, has raised concerns that additional projected price hikes could trigger supply shortages as soon as next winter.\n\n“We must become independent from Russian oil, coal and gas,” Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, said in a statement on Monday. “We simply cannot rely on a supplier who explicitly threatens us. We need to act now to mitigate the impact of rising energy prices, diversify our gas supply for next winter and accelerate the clean energy transition.”\n\nThe European Commission recently unveiled a plan for how the region could transition away from Russian fossil fuels before 2030, involving a near-term push to find fossil fuel alternatives to Russia’s gas imports and maximize energy efficiency combined with a longer-term shift away from fossil fuels to renewable energy consistent with the region’s existing climate plans.\n\n“I view this as an important step in fostering the decarbonization of the European economy,” Andreas Goldthau, an energy transition expert at the Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies, told BuzzFeed News by email.\n\nThe commission’s modeling suggests something to the tune of “two-thirds of Russian gas being replaced within one year only through those measures, which strikes me as very ambitious,” Goldthau said. He later added: “At current prices, this would mean a significant cost to industry and households, and possibly a too high cost to some.”\n\nMeanwhile, also on Monday, President Joe Biden announced the US would immediately ban Russian energy imports, yet another layer of economic sanctions meant to punish the country for its attack on Ukraine.\n\n“We’re moving forward on this ban, understanding that many of our European allies and partners may not be in a position to join us,” Biden said, noting that US domestic oil production gives the country flexibility Europe does not have.\n\nBut even with vast fossil fuel production at home, the US is not immune to the dramatic fluctuations in energy prices set by global energy markets.

And every year, agencies would have to submit to Congress a report on human rights abuses that have occurred at US-funded projects.\n\nThe House Committee on Natural Resources has been looking into the issue in response to a 2019 BuzzFeed News investigation that found that the World Wide Fund for Nature, a beloved wildlife conservation charity and a longtime partner of the US government, had closely backed anti-poaching forces who tortured and killed people in national parks in Asia and Africa.\n\nVillagers living near the parks had been whipped with belts, attacked with machetes, beaten unconscious with bamboo sticks, sexually assaulted, and shot, according to reports and documents obtained by BuzzFeed News. Rangers at WWF-supported parks committed several alleged unlawful killings.\n\nIn 2019, now-retired Republican member of Congress Rob Bishop of Utah, then the committee’s ranking member, proposed a law covering similar ground. Bishop’s bill stalled, but since then lawmakers in both parties have picked the issue back up.\n\nThis year’s bill has bipartisan support. Its sponsors are committee chair Rep. Raúl M. Grijalva, Democrat of Arizona, and ranking member Rep. Bruce Westerman, Republican of Arkansas. The rest of the committee will now debate the legislation, and if they approve it, it will be sent to the House floor for a full vote.\n\n“With this bill, we are sending a signal to the world that the United States demands the highest standards of respect for every human life; we will not tolerate human rights abuses in the name of conservation,” Grijalva said. “I hope that the renewed focus on human rights, accountability, and oversight in this bill will be a model for conservation programs both in the U.S. and abroad.”\n\nWesterman said the “common sense legislation” would increase government accountability. “This bill is the culmination of bipartisan efforts, including an investigation and oversight hearing that exposed misuse of grant money, human rights violations, and a stunning lack of federal agency awareness.”\n\nThe bill would introduce sweeping changes to how US agencies deal with human rights abuses at conservation projects. Conservation groups receiving government cash would have to provide human rights policies detailing what procedures they would follow if abuses occurred. They would also have to name anyone they partner with abroad, such as local police forces or park rangers — who would then be vetted by the Fish and Wildlife Service and State Department.\n\nThe legislation would also increase the extent to which Indigenous peoples are protected in conservation projects that affect them. Donor recipients would have to show that they have a process for “meaningful consultation” with Indigenous people before their historic lands are used for conservation, and that they offer a “grievance redress mechanism” for Indigenous people to raise concerns.\n\nWhen abuses are discovered, they would have to be reported to the federal government, and the group receiving taxpayer money would have 60 days to design a plan to resolve the issue. The US government would be able to halt funding for the project until the director of the Fish and Wildlife Service and the Secretary of State confirm that those involved have taken “effective steps to bring perpetrators to justice and prevent human rights violations.”\n\nSerious human rights abuses would also be referred to the Department of Interior inspector general, and the Fish and Wildlife Service would send to Congress each year a report summarizing investigations carried out under the act, including remedial actions taken.\n\nJohn Knox, a former UN Special Rapporteur for human rights and the environment, called the bill “a huge step forward in an area that really needs greater attention, and a potential model for other governments and international funders.\" After the WWF scandal broke, it became clear that “many of the major sources of international conservation funding, including the United Nations and the United States, did not have effective standards in place to ensure that their funds wouldn't be used for human rights abuses,” Knox said.\n\nIn a statement, WWF said it was in favor of the legislation. \"Safeguarding the rights of communities is fundamental to the success of conservation. We support the goals of this bill to strengthen programs that conserve nature and wildlife by ensuring they also protect and promote the rights, wellbeing, and safety of local and Indigenous communities in the landscapes where the programs operate.\"\n\nThe charity conducted its own internal review into the allegations, and in 2020 expressed “deep and unreserved sorrow for those who have suffered,” saying that abuses by park rangers “horrify us and go against all the values for which we stand.”\n\n","source":null},{"_id":{"$oid":"625c4dcaceb2b567b3df84d7"},"feed_source":"BuzzFeed News","title":"Russian Troops Pounded The Town Of Irpin.

The film depicts Russian mercenaries as saviors who prevent Ukraine’s government from committing a genocide against its own people — mirroring Putin’s claim that he invaded Ukraine in order to “prevent genocide” and “denazify” the country. It’s just the latest example of a reality-bending new species of Russian propaganda that now includes dozens of videos of Ukrainian attacks on Russian citizens that appear to be faked, videos depicting a joint raid by the FBI and NYPD of a New York movie theater that the venue says never happened, and repurposed Cameo videos of Rudy Giuliani and Donald Trump Jr. unwittingly congratulating a fictional film character on his achievements. The man behind the camera: Yevgeny Prigozhin, an oligarch also known as “Putin’s chef,” who was recently sanctioned by the US and the EU for helping lead “a disinformation war against Ukraine.” His apparent motivation: to influence the course of Russia’s future by rewriting its past.\n\nMisha Japaridze / AP Prigozhin (left) serves food to then–prime minister Vladimir Putin during dinner at Prigozhin’s restaurant outside Moscow on Nov. 11, 2011.\n\nOne of Putin’s close confidants, Prigozhin is believed to have been at the forefront of Russia’s disinformation apparatus since at least 2013. The FBI has put him on its Most Wanted list because he “allegedly oversaw and approved” the “political and electoral interference operations” of the country's infamous troll factory, the Internet Research Agency. He has also been linked to the Russian mercenary group Wagner, which European security officials believe helped lay the groundwork for last month’s invasion. Last week, the US Treasury Department added Prigozhin’s wife, daughter, and son to the list of Russian elites sanctioned for disinformation efforts around the Ukraine invasion. The role of his films in Russia’s propaganda offensive, meanwhile, has largely gone unexamined. Since mid-2020, the St. Petersburg–based film company Aurum LLC, which lists Prigozhin as co-owner on Russian business records, has produced at least seven feature films that use Hollywood production techniques to fictionalize Russia’s global exploits. The Shugaley trilogy, for example, claims to tell the true story of Maxim Shugaley, who was arrested in Libya in 2019 for allegedly working to elect the fugitive son of fallen dictator Muammar Gaddafi. The trilogy portrays Shugaley as a beleaguered sociologist fighting for freedom against a corrupt regime. This narrative was later adopted by Russia’s foreign ministry, which used it to advocate for Shugaley’s eventual release in late 2020.\n\nAurum productions Posters for Blazing Sun. The posters read: “Donbass. Declassified facts. In theaters soon.”\n\nBlazing Sun, another Aurum production, lays out the “denazification” narrative that would later be used to justify Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Upon its release, the film “hit Ukraine” like an “information bomb,” said Vladislav Berdichevsky, a pro-Kremlin foreign policy and information strategist, speaking with Russian media last August. The film’s strategy feels uncannily similar to the Biden administration’s prediction that Russia would use “a very graphic propaganda video,” complete with actors and elaborate production techniques, as a pretext for an invasion. “It is very, very eerie to see how closely that movie’s narrative tracks with the story being pushed by the Russian state right now,” said Jack Margolin, program director at DC's Center for Advanced Defense Studies. He noted that the film was likely part of a larger project “to demonize Ukrainians as either Nazis or Western pawns and consequently justify intervention.” Ukraine’s government apparently agrees; in November, it banned the filmography of more than 30 actors and crew members involved in the film's production, citing national security concerns.\n\n“It is very, very eerie to see how closely that movie’s narrative tracks with the story being pushed by the Russian state right now.”\n\nThe film was resurrected in the aftermath of the invasion, with online posters for it strewn across Russian propaganda sites alongside banner ads for a “Stop Nazism” hotline, imploring residents of Ukraine to “share the truth about all the crimes that are happening now and have been happening for the past eight years.” By March 2022, the film’s journey had come full circle, when Lt. Col. Andrey Marochko — another key player in Russia’s military arsenal — told Russian media that Ukrainian soldiers should be shown the film because they had been in an “information vacuum.” The propaganda effort has coincided with the Kremlin’s recent crackdown on Russia’s independent news media. For months, Prigozhin and lesser-known Russian figures, including Shugaley and anti-globalization activist Alexander Ionov, have filed a string of complaints and lawsuits against independent Russian news outlets such as Meduza and Ekho Moskvy, in some cases resulting in them being labeled “foreign agents” and inhibiting their ability to work within Russia. Last year, Prigozhin told Meduza that “foreign agents” are “enemies of the people” and should be shot. Last week, Russia’s State Duma passed a sweeping new law banning all content that challenges the Kremlin’s official line on Ukraine. According to the New York Times, the crackdown has led to some Ukrainians facing a backlash from relatives in Russia who have bought into Putin’s narrative.\n\nAnton Novoderezhkin / TASS via Getty Images Russian State Duma member Maria Butina attends a congress of the United Russia party.\n\nMaria Butina, a State Duma member convicted in the US in 2018 for acting as an unregistered agent of the Kremlin, told BuzzFeed News that she felt the new law was justified because “fake news and giving people untruthful and fake information is very bad.” Those who break the law, she said, “are criminals [and] should be in jail.” Butina confirmed that she currently advises Shugaley’s pro-Kremlin think tank, the Foundation for the Protection of National Values, which was sanctioned by the US Treasury Department last year for allegedly “supporting Prigozhin’s global influence operations.” Reached for comment, Prigozhin mocked our questions and threatened to block further inquiries.\n\nFilm Premier via YouTube / Via youtube.com Stills from The 16th\n\nIf Blazing Sun shows how Prigozhin’s films exploit and influence real-world events, the promotional campaign for another recent Prigozhin film shows how elaborate Russia’s troll tactics have become. The 16th, released in November 2021, adds satirical comedy to Prigozhin’s repertoire. In the film, the Internet Research Agency is reimagined as a small group of toy factory workers who must devise a series of increasingly outlandish schemes in order to repay a debt — but end up unintentionally swaying the 2016 US presidential election in Donald Trump’s favor. The film’s marketing campaign used US social media sites to spread and promote videos similar to those that seem to justify Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Remarkably, it also included home videos — purchased via Cameo — of Donald Trump Jr. and Rudy Giuliani that were repurposed to make it appear that they were congratulating the film's fictional protagonist on his success. The content was then used to generate headlines across dozens of Russian-language state media sites. One video, posted on Nov. 6 from a Twitter account with the name Jay Belichick, claimed to depict a joint raid by the FBI and the NYPD of New York’s Angelika Film Center during the premiere screening of the film, complete with a dozen agents and at least one attendee being forcibly removed from their seat.\n\nScreenshot via Twitter\n\nTwenty-two minutes later, a Twitter user by the name of Jason Devine posted a second video of the same incident, ostensibly filmed from a different seat in the theater.\n\nScreenshot via Twitter\n\nWithin hours, stories with headlines like “New York Police Disrupted the Premiere of Prigozhin’s Film” and “Militiamen Interfered With the Premiere of Prigozhin’s Film” began popping up on sites like Riafan.ru, Polit.info, and other prominent outlets that are part of Patriot Media Group, a Russian media conglomerate whose board of trustees is led by Prigozhin. “The Angelika did not host any such screening of a film with any variation of this title and based on the footage, this is definitely not our location,” a spokesperson for the theater told BuzzFeed News. (The FBI and NYPD did not return requests for comment.)\n\n“​​Prigozhin-linked groups create fake social media accounts, and then embed manufactured quotes from these accounts into ideologically aligned news outlets.”\n\nA reverse image search reveals that Belichick’s Twitter profile photo and bio belong to Jay Mula, an Atlanta–based radio host who told BuzzFeed News that he recently lost access to the account after it was hacked. Twitter confirmed that Mula’s account had been compromised but said it had found no evidence of Russian involvement. The site subsequently suspended four related accounts that promoted the video, including one account that previously belonged to a Guyanese woman who died in 2018. The site declined to comment further, citing its platform manipulation and spam policy. “​​Prigozhin-linked groups create fake social media accounts, and then embed manufactured quotes from these accounts into ideologically aligned news outlets,” said Shelby Grossman, a top research scholar at Stanford Internet Observatory. “It’s a new addition to Prigozhin’s deceptive propaganda toolkit. We have seen Prigozhin-linked entities creating fake Twitter accounts for this purpose to push narratives about Syria, Central African Republic, and Libya.” In a recently published study, Grossman noted that Twitter had suspended a network of 50 accounts widely reported to be linked to Prigozhin’s troll factory for similar behavior. Though none of the tweets had high engagement, the commentary they provided “could be pushed out to entirely different audiences to illustrate supposed points of view from real people about important and often divisive political and policy issues,” the study said. The recent emergence of such tactics, Grossman told BuzzFeed News, “may be in part due to the cat-and-mouse game [Prigozhin is] playing with the platforms and the need to evolve to avoid detection.” BuzzFeed News observed a variation of the same strategy playing out across Russian state media, in which unsuspecting celebrities such as Charlie Sheen and Dolph Lundgren recorded messages of support for characters from Prigozhin’s films, inspiring more headlines back home. (Sheen and Lundgren did not respond to a request for comment.) Enter Donald Trump Jr. and Rudy Giuliani. In November, the two men recorded personal videos that were recast to make it appear they were celebrating “Uncle Nick,” an entirely fictional character in The 16th who, at 6 years old, single-handedly outwits the entire FBI and destroys American democracy. “Never abandon your path, and America will be proud of you,” Giuliani says in one of two videos addressed to the fictional character.\n\nRudy Giuliani in a Cameo message: “Never abandon your path, and America will be proud of you.” Provided to BuzzFeed News Donald Trump Jr. in a Cameo message: “Keep helping your brother to stand for what’s right and I hope you get that new house.” Provided to BuzzFeed News\n\nAs with Belichick’s tweet, the videos were later embedded into stories published across Patriot Media’s network of state media sites. “The ex-president’s son and politician Giuliani congratulated ‘Uncle Nick’ from the movie ‘16th’ on his birthday,” read one headline on Rueconomics.ru. A photo caption on the article claimed that the men were inspired to record their videos after being “among the first viewers of Yevgeny Prigozhin’s film ‘16th.’” Giuliani’s Cameo page reveals that his video was in fact a paid commission.

The agency highlighted Facebook’s recent restriction of Kremlin-tied media sources RT and Sputnik across the EU.\n\n“Soon millions of ordinary Russians will find themselves cut off from reliable information, deprived of their everyday ways of connecting with family and friends and silenced from speaking out,” Nick Clegg, president of global affairs for Meta, Facebook's parent company, wrote on Twitter in response. “We will continue to do everything we can to restore our services so they remain available to people to safely and securely express themselves and organize for action.”\n\n\n\nHours later, Russian news agency Interfax reported that Roskomnadzor had also begun blocking Twitter. Despite the reports, a Twitter spokesperson said the company doesn't see \"anything significantly different\" than throttling that had been reported earlier.\n\nThe blocks would escalate earlier restrictions on Facebook and Twitter by the Kremlin. Last week, Clegg said Russia had restricted use of the company’s services. The throttling was in response to Meta’s refusal to stop independent fact-checking of Russian state-backed media. Clegg in turn said Meta would keep its apps, including Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, available to Russians.\n\nThe Russian government also began throttling Twitter last week, and data from global internet monitor NetBlocks revealed the platform was being restricted across a handful of Russian telecommunications service providers. At the time, Twitter said it was aware of the restriction and said it was “working to keep [its] service safe and accessible.”\n\nOn Thursday, Russian-language Twitter users began commenting that Facebook, along with the BBC and independent Russian news outlet Meduza, were blocked in Russia.\n\nHowever, data from GlobalCheck, a service that tracks internet censorship in countries like Russia and Belarus, showed that Russia was throttling Facebook. User connections to Facebook in Russia bottomed out at 25% that day, the most throttled the platform had been since the start of the invasion last month.\n\n“​​This is the exact ambiguity that throttling and partial restrictions aim to create,” NetBlocks told BuzzFeed News on Thursday. “There's no clear point at which the slowing of a website or social media platform renders it unusable. And in this regard, the act of throttling becomes an information warfare tool in and of itself.”\n\nRussia’s government has recently relied on throttling as a way to censor internet platforms. Last year, Roskomnadzor debuted a novel technique that effectively restricted access to Twitter during anti-Putin protests. Prior to that, Roskomnadzor announced that it had slowed Twitter service speeds because it claimed the company failed to remove content related to child pornography, drugs, and suicide. At the time, research group Censored Planet called this “the first known centrally controlled attempt by the Russian government to use throttling (instead of outright blocking).”\n\nAs Russia continues its invasion, Silicon Valley companies have been caught in the middle. Facebook and Twitter said they took down two anti-Ukrainian disinformation campaigns over the weekend. Meta, TikTok, and YouTube, owned by Google, have also banned Kremlin-backed outlets RT and Sputnik from their platforms in Europe. Reddit has banned users from posting links to Russian state-owned media. Apple and Google have also removed RT from their app stores outside of Russia.\n\n","source":null},{"_id":{"$oid":"625c4dd7ceb2b567b3df84da"},"feed_source":"BuzzFeed News","title":"“Our Duty”: Ukrainian Surgeons Are Operating On Russian Soldiers Wounded In Ukraine","link":"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/christopherm51/ukraine-surgeons-wounded-russian-soldiers","published":"Mon, 07 Mar 2022 22:25:05 -0500","author":"Christopher Miller","summary":"KYIV — Vitaliy, a young doctor from western Ukraine on a surgery apprenticeship in Kyiv, has hardly left his emergency ward in the 12 days since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of the country.\nVitaliy told BuzzFeed News that he operates nearly around the clock on soldiers and civilians wounded by air strikes, artillery fire, and gunshots in the fight for the Ukrainian capital.\nAmong the dozens he has helped, he said there was something different about three soldiers who were brought in about a week ago.\nThey spoke only Russian — and with an accent more common in Moscow than in Kyiv.\nHospital staff and Ukrainian police were eventually able to confirm the men were Russian soldiers, Vitaliy said in an interview Thursday.","published_parsed":[2022,3,8,3,25,5,1,67,0],"authors":[{"name":"Christopher Miller"}],"tags":["operating","staff","kyiv","uniforms","soldiers","vitaliy","duty","surgeons","ukraine","ukrainian","russian","wounded","buzzfeed","helping"],"comments":null,"content":"KYIV — Vitaliy, a young doctor from western Ukraine on a surgery apprenticeship in Kyiv, has hardly left his emergency ward in the 12 days since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of the country. Vitaliy told BuzzFeed News that he operates nearly around the clock on soldiers and civilians wounded by air strikes, artillery fire, and gunshots in the fight for the Ukrainian capital.\n\nAmong the dozens he has helped, he said there was something different about three soldiers who were brought in about a week ago. They were wearing Ukrainian-type uniforms and claimed they were from Kyiv, but they couldn’t speak a word of Ukrainian, name a single neighborhood in the capital city, or offer up any documentation to prove their residency. They spoke only Russian — and with an accent more common in Moscow than in Kyiv. And they behaved in a somewhat cold manner toward the medical staff treating them, refusing to answer many questions.\n\nHospital staff and Ukrainian police were eventually able to confirm the men were Russian soldiers, Vitaliy said in an interview Thursday. “They were very scared.”\n\nDeputy Defense Minister Hanna Malyar wrote on Facebook on Feb. 25 that Russian forces had “seized two Ukrainian army vehicles and changed into Ukrainian uniforms” during a failed assault on the northern Obolon district of Kyiv. Similar information has circulated in other military reports.\n\nThe soldiers who Vitaliy operated on are believed by Kyiv authorities to have participated in that initial assault on the capital that has continued in the days since.\n\nVitaliy spoke to BuzzFeed News on the condition that his last name and the hospital he works at are not printed for security reasons, but he sent BuzzFeed News two videos to verify where he worked. He said the three soldiers on whom he operated were conscious when they arrived, adding that they had been shot several times and one of the men’s legs was broken.\n\n“One of them was very seriously wounded and he died,” he said.\n\nThe other two survived and are being kept in a small jail inside the hospital while they recover, Vitaliy said.\n\nVitaliy felt deeply conflicted about helping save enemy lives.\n\n“I think we should help them but of course sometimes the feeling I have about it is horrible. It feels like I’m doing something wrong,” he said. “Like, I can be helping my people but I have to spend time helping that piece of shit.”\n\nIt’s especially hard to show compassion given the brutality that Putin and his military have unleashed on Ukrainians. Bombs and shells have razed entire towns.

Economic advisers and crypto researchers have warned that bitcoin and other currencies could be used to fund Russia’s war efforts, and protect the wealth of its oligarchs.\n\n\n\nIn a letter to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on Wednesday, a group of senators, including Elizabeth Warren and Senate Intelligence Committee Chair Mark Warner, asked about the agency’s plans to monitor crypto networks for evidence of Russian leaders moving money and to enforce sanction compliance. “Criminals, rogue states, and other actors may use digital assets and alternative payment platforms as a new means to hide cross-border transactions for nefarious purposes,” the senators wrote, citing the Treasury's own 2021 report that warned of crypto’s ability to undermine the efficacy of US sanctions.\n\nLast year, the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) issued guidance for evaluating and mitigating the risks that crypto markets pose to sanctions. An OFAC report asked technology companies and crypto users to decline to engage in “dealings with blocked persons or property.”\n\nThis new letter reiterates those same concerns and asks specifically how OFAC is working with foreign governments to enforce its guidance and what roadblocks have prevented it from doing so.\n\nAt the same time the letter was sent, US Attorney General Merrick Garland announced a new interagency task force, KleptoCapture, which will be dedicated to enforcing sanctions and other economic restrictions that the US has imposed on Russia. “The Task Force will be fully empowered to use the most cutting-edge investigative techniques,” such as cryptocurrency tracing, to arrest and prosecute individuals found in violation, the announcement noted.\n\nWhile these coinciding announcements do not appear to be a joint effort, together they mark the most formalized attempt to investigate the role of crypto networks in Russia’s attack on Ukraine.\n\nIn the last week, Ukraine has asked crypto exchanges to block all Russian accounts. “It's crucial to freeze not only the addresses linked to Russian and Belarusian politicians, but also to sabotage ordinary users,” Mykhailo Fedorov, Ukraine’s minister of digital transformation, tweeted on Sunday.\n\nSo far, the crypto industry has largely ignored or condemned calls to freeze Russian holdings. ​​Changpeng Zhao, founder of the world’s largest crypto exchange Binance, told BBC Radio 4 that the company was “not in a position to sanction, like, populations of people,” and said Binance would only respond to requests regarding specific individuals. Another large exchange, Coinbase, told Motherboard that it will not comply with Ukraine’s request in the interest of “economic freedom.”\n\nBloomberg reported that the White House’s National Security Council and the Treasury Department similarly asked exchanges to aid their efforts.

Take extreme heat and heat waves: Pregnant people, babies, and young kids are all more vulnerable to heat than older kids and most adults because their bodies aren’t as good at cooling and staying that way. Studies even show that an unborn child’s exposure to extreme heat while in the womb could result in negative health outcomes later, such as lower birth weight.\n\nFor older kids, as the number of hot days increases with global warming, they risk greater exposure to the heat in schools without air conditioning and during outdoor activities, like sports.\n\nThis latest IPCC assessment also discusses how disasters, both the acute exposure to one and then the longer-term recovery from one, can damage the mental health and well-being of everyone impacted, especially kids.\n\nAfter major flooding occurred in the United Kingdom in 2000, for instance, researchers tracked the health of people whose homes flooded and did not flood, according to Kristie Ebi of the University of Washington, who helped co-write the report’s chapter on health. “There was a very clear difference in probable anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder” between the different groups, she explained.\n\nHeadline-spurring disasters, which are growing more frequent and more intense, are perhaps the most obvious signs of how 1.1 degrees Celsius of warming, compared to pre-industrial times, is playing out. But there are far more climate impacts already here, as the new report exhaustively details.\n\nEven before my daughter was born, for example, two species went extinct and climate change played a role: the Golden toad in Costa Rica in 1990, as well as Australia’s Bramble Cay melomys, a type of rodent, in 2016. And a third species got perilously close to extinction: Australia’s lemuroid ringtail possum. And there have been far more local extinctions: Climate-linked local extinctions were detected in 47% of 976 animal and plant species examined.\n\n\n\nThe impact of climate change on top of existing problems of food availability and high prices can be a “lethal combination for kids,” said Rachel Bezner Kerr of Cornell University, a coauthor on the IPCC chapter on food systems, “especially in low-income countries, especially low-income households, especially in rural areas.”\n\n“So we have one study that showed between 1993 and 2012, increased temperatures was significantly related to children’s wasting in 30 countries in Africa,” she added. Wasting refers to a child that is too thin for their height, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nMalnutrition is already a huge problem in kids in certain developing nations, and that problem will only get bigger in a warmer world if action isn’t specifically taken to avoid that possibility.\n\nHow Hot Will It Get In My Daughter’s Lifetime?\n\nWhen world leaders signed the Paris climate agreement in 2016, they agreed to jointly limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius (about 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), ideally to 1.5 degrees Celsius.\n\nNow scientists predict that it is “more likely than not” that global average temperatures will pass 1.5 degrees in the coming decades, no matter what. It could happen by 2030, when my daughter is only 10 years old.\n\nThat’s why the next few years matter so much. How quickly people cut their greenhouse gas emissions this decade will help dictate how the 1.5-degree threshold is exceeded and what happens next. Will temperatures keep going up or will they start to come back down?\n\nMoreover, what people do now to start adapting to the warming that’s already here and locked in for the future will minimize the damage associated with the crisis.\n\nBy 2030, for example, it’s possible that countries will embrace the bold goal of protecting at least 30% of the planet’s land and water. If so, that could have cascading benefits, from keeping some species alive to bolstering natural ecosystems that protect against floods, help suck up carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere, and do much more. And if China transitioned to a half-decarbonized power supply for homes and vehicles by 2030, per the report, the country could expect to prevent 55,000-69,000 deaths in that year.\n\nIt’s also possible that urban areas may see their exposure to flooding go up 2.7 times by 2030 compared to 2000, or that an additional 48,000 children under the age of 15 globally may die from diarrhea, or that the number of people living in extreme poverty may increase by 122 million, or that extreme droughts in the Amazon will accelerate the migration of traditional communities and Indigenous peoples to cities, or that freshwater will be severely limited for some small islands.\n\nBy 2040, when my daughter is 20, the glacier on Africa’s tallest mountain, Mt. Kilimanjaro in Tanzania, may be gone.","source":null},{"_id":{"$oid":"625c4deeceb2b567b3df84df"},"feed_source":"BuzzFeed News","title":"Russia's Invasion Is Breaking Up Ukrainian Families And The Photos Are Heartbreaking","link":"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/davidmack/ukraine-family-farewell-photos-men-stay-fight","published":"Sun, 06 Mar 2022 06:25:06 -0500","author":"David Mack","summary":"As Russian missiles hit their towns and tanks roll through their streets, many Ukrainians have been forced to flee their homeland.\nIn an exodus that is unparalleled in recent European history, more than 1.2 million Ukrainians have sought sanctuary in neighboring countries since the Russian invasion began last week, UN High Commissioner of Refugees Filippo Grandi said Friday.\nBut many others have stayed to fight.\nUkraine's government has enacted martial law and required men ages 18 to 60 to remain in the country in order to defend it against the Russian attack.\nThat has led to heartbreaking scenes at train and bus stations across the country as children say goodbye to their fathers and wives bid farewell to their husbands.","published_parsed":[2022,3,6,11,25,6,6,65,0],"authors":[{"name":"David Mack"}],"tags":["russias","towns","tanks","families","train","photos","heartbreaking","unparalleled","ukrainian","country","invasion","russian","wives","breaking","streets","week","ukrainians"],"comments":null,"content":"As Russian missiles hit their towns and tanks roll through their streets, many Ukrainians have been forced to flee their homeland.\n\nIn an exodus that is unparalleled in recent European history, more than 1.2 million Ukrainians have sought sanctuary in neighboring countries since the Russian invasion began last week, UN High Commissioner of Refugees Filippo Grandi said Friday.\n\nBut many others have stayed to fight.\n\nUkraine's government has enacted martial law and required men ages 18 to 60 to remain in the country in order to defend it against the Russian attack.\n\nThat has led to heartbreaking scenes at train and bus stations across the country as children say goodbye to their fathers and wives bid farewell to their husbands.","source":null},{"_id":{"$oid":"625c4df2ceb2b567b3df84e0"},"feed_source":"BuzzFeed News","title":"Google Maps Blocked Edits After People Falsely Claimed It Was Used to Coordinate Russian Air Strikes","link":"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/sarahemerson/russia-google-maps-tags-ukraine","published":"Fri, 04 Mar 2022 00:35:35 -0500","author":"Richard Nieva","summary":"On Thursday, the State Special Communications Service of Ukraine called claims that Google Maps \"labels\" were being used by Russia's military \"another fake.\"\nOn Tuesday, responding to claims that its Maps were being used to coordinate Russian military activity in Ukraine, Google began removing user-submitted locations within the borders of Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus.\nAcross social media platforms on Tuesday, people accused Google Maps of hosting content allegedly used to target airstrikes on cities such as Kyiv and Kharkiv.\nAfter investigating the claims, Google said that some of the edits that reference farms were made more than a year ago.\nGoogle also told BuzzFeed News on Thursday that it is implementing an analysis of Ukraine maps data to detect and remove inaccurate business information.","published_parsed":[2022,3,4,5,35,35,4,63,0],"authors":[{"name":"Sarah Emerson"},{"name":"Richard Nieva"}],"tags":["removing","господарство","claims","coordinate","maps","used","edits","ukraine","ukrainian","strikes","claimed","russian","falsely","told","blocked","tags","google"],"comments":null,"content":"On Thursday, the State Special Communications Service of Ukraine called claims that Google Maps \"labels\" were being used by Russia's military \"another fake.\" In a post to its official Telegram channel, the country's intelligence agency debunked a wave of social media rumors that claimed Russian insurgents had tagged airstrike locations on Google Maps of Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities.\n\nThe agency described these false claims as a psychological operation \"to sow panic and misinformation among the population.\"\n\n\n\nOn Tuesday, responding to claims that its Maps were being used to coordinate Russian military activity in Ukraine, Google began removing user-submitted locations within the borders of Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus.

Still, the company said it is removing edits made to maps in the region since Feb. 24, and it would pause new edits.\n\n“Out of an abundance of caution, we are removing user contributions like photos, videos, reviews and business information and all user-submitted places from Google Maps in Ukraine, Russia and Belarus since the invasion began, and are temporarily blocking new edits from being made,” a Google spokesperson said.\n\nGoogle also told BuzzFeed News on Thursday that it is implementing an analysis of Ukraine maps data to detect and remove inaccurate business information.\n\n","source":null},{"_id":{"$oid":"625c4df6ceb2b567b3df84e1"},"feed_source":"BuzzFeed News","title":"Ukrainians Are Desperately Trying To Flee Kyiv As The Russians Advance: “It’s An Absolute Nightmare”","link":"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/christopherm51/ukrainians-flee-kyiv-russian-invasion","published":"Tue, 08 Mar 2022 00:10:52 -0500","author":"Christopher Miller","summary":"KYIV — They threw themselves, and whatever possessions they were able to take with them, onto the departing train Monday at Kyiv’s central railway station as Russian forces continued to inch closer to the capital city.\nA pink unicorn backpack the mother had slung over her shoulder didn’t make it and tumbled to the tracks.\nIn fact, as they gathered, Russia was threatening to fire missiles on government buildings and installations, including one belonging to the Security Service of Ukraine.\nJust two hours after BuzzFeed News’ visit to the station, Russian missiles struck the Kyiv TV tower, killing five civilians and wounding five others.\nThe international agency warned that the flood of people leaving the country could quickly become “Europe’s largest refugee crisis this century.”Beneath the golden chandeliers and delicate mosaics adorning the baroque walls of the Kyiv station, many thousands more scrambled to join them.","published_parsed":[2022,3,8,5,10,52,1,67,0],"authors":[{"name":"Christopher Miller"}],"tags":["nightmare","kyiv","absolute","station","trying","train","trains","ukrainian","missiles","woman","mother","flee","russian","let","advance","russians","ukrainians","desperately"],"comments":null,"content":"KYIV — They threw themselves, and whatever possessions they were able to take with them, onto the departing train Monday at Kyiv’s central railway station as Russian forces continued to inch closer to the capital city.\n\nIn the chaos, a young mother was separated from her daughter when a police officer hoisted the girl onto the train, but it began rolling away before the woman could jump on.

Akamai, like its competitor Cloudflare, runs much of the plumbing that supports the internet.\n\nA few days later, the teapot error vanished, and mil.ru and websites of prominent Russian banks such as Gazprombank went dark for most internet users outside Russia. The government had geofenced key websites — meaning those outside the country couldn’t access these sites, and so couldn’t hack them.\n\n“I assume the Russians realized that pretty much whatever they are trying to do to everyone else, the same thing can be done to them,” Serper said. “By geofencing you are making it impossible for someone outside Russia to reach all those targets.”\n\nIn other words, Russia had expected retaliation for its invasion of Ukraine and had already preempted the cyberattacks it suspected were coming — and come they did.\n\nA day after the invasion began, Reuters reported that a prominent Ukrainian entrepreneur was working closely with his government to assemble a phalanx of volunteers for cyber offense and cyber defense. While the offense would conduct espionage operations, the defense would secure critical infrastructure such as Ukraine’s power plants and water treatment facilities that have been targeted by Russia in the past. Then Ukrainian Vice Prime Minister Mykhailo Fedorov called for volunteers to join a Telegram channel for the IT Army of Ukraine. “There will be tasks for everyone. We continue to fight on the cyber front,” Federov said.\n\nSince then, social media accounts associated with hacker collectives and pro-Ukraine Telegram groups claim that groups such as Anonymous have taken some Russian websites and servers offline.

Fear of catching COVID in the detention center’s tight quarters didn’t help.\n\nJosmith said he felt like he was \"suffocating\" and that he \"could die here.\"\n\nICE detainees like Josmith, who due to preexisting medical conditions are at greater risk of serious side effects from contracting COVID-19, can be released under a federal court injunction issued in 2020. Amid soaring COVID rates, a judge at the time ordered authorities to identify all ICE detainees who are at higher risk of severe illness and death and to strongly consider releasing them unless they posed a danger to property or people.\n\nIn an Oct. 7, 2020, court filing in the case, US District Judge Jesus Bernal said that “only in rare cases” would ICE fail to release at-risk immigrants who are not subject to mandatory detention.\n\nHundreds of immigrants have since been released. But as the pandemic progressed, attorneys and advocates said immigrants like Josmith fell through the cracks. In order to get some medically vulnerable people released, attorneys had to pressure ICE, but advocates said that’s not a solution for detainees who don’t have access to legal representation.\n\nEarly on in his stay, Josmith, who agreed to be identified for this story only by his first name, said he filed more than a dozen requests to see a doctor about his asthma, but they were ignored. He was able to finally see a doctor in early February after nearly collapsing from a lack of oxygen. Medical staffers at Cibola County Correctional Center, which is operated for ICE by the private prison company CoreCivic, told Josmith he had high blood pressure. He was given medication and told he would be seeing a doctor again in the morning, but that never happened. On Feb. 7, three days after he collapsed, he was given an inhaler to treat his asthma, ICE said.\n\nHis lawyer, Zoe Bowman from Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center, said that despite his medical condition, ICE refused to release him under the court order.\n\nWhat may have contributed to Josmith’s struggle to be released is that he didn’t initially tell immigration officials that he had asthma. Bowman said Josmith later tried to tell medical staff by filing requests to see a doctor that were all ignored. In an attempt to get Josmith released, Bowman had also submitted a copy and certified translation of his asthma diagnosis from Haiti.\n\n“Having asthma is a clear-cut and straight reason for him to be released,” Bowman said.\n\nBowman noted that she’s had to send multiple emails to ICE and make phone calls to push for the release of immigrants with high-risk medical conditions who’ve been in detention for months.\n\n“It doesn’t feel like ICE is at all complying with the order as it should,” she said. “There are very few pro bono lawyers serving thousands of ICE beds, and it feels like we’re only coming across these cases by chance.”\n\nWhen Bowman asked ICE about the multiple medical requests Josmith submitted, the agency told her it hadn't received any since November.\n\n“It seems like this bizarre situation where the official records aren’t matching what’s happening inside detention,” she said. “The lack of medical care is leading to some pretty scary situations for people who are detained there for months and months.”\n\nJosmith was released from Cibola County Correctional Center on Feb. 16 after the agency received an inquiry about his status from BuzzFeed News.\n\nIn a statement, an ICE official said Josmith had been given an Albuterol inhaler on Feb. 7 and released on Feb. 16. He was released on an alternative to detention program, ICE said, which uses technology and case management to track immigrants outside of detention.\n\n\"ICE continues to evaluate individuals based upon the CDC’s guidance for people who might be at higher risk for severe illness as a result of COVID-19 to determine whether continued detention was appropriate,\" the immigration enforcement agency said.\n\nICE said Josmith had been ordered removed by an immigration judge, but filed a pending appeal on Jan. 14.\n\nMatthew Davio, a spokesperson for Corecivic, in a statement said the company cares deeply about every person in their care. All of their immigration facilities are monitored closely by ICE and are required to undergo regular reviews, he said.\n\nCibola County Correctional Center's health services team follows CoreCivic's standards for medical care and ICE's Performance Based National Detention Standards, Davio said.\n\nCorecivic, Davio said, doesn't have a role or influence over the release process for medically vulnerable immigrants because of COVID-19.\n\n\"Our staff are trained and held to the highest ethical standards. Our commitment to keeping those entrusted to our care safe and secure is our top priority,\" Davio said. \"We vehemently deny any allegations of detainee mistreatment.\"\n\nThe Cibola County Correctional Center has for years come under criticism for its lack of medical care for the immigrants held there.\n\nIn 2020, Reuters found hundreds of unanswered requests for medical attention at ICE's only dedicated detention unit for transgender immigrants, which was housed at the Cibola County Correctional Center. The report also found that quarantine procedures were poorly enforced and that detainees with mental illnesses and chronic diseases received deficient treatment. These problems led to the temporary closure and transfer of transgender women to other ICE facilities.\n\nA secret memo sent by a top Department of Homeland Security official to ICE leadership obtained by BuzzFeed News, revealed how immigrants at Cibola County Correctional Center sometimes waited up to 17 days for urgently needed medical care, were exposed to poor sanitation and quarantine practices during a chickenpox and mumps outbreak, and didn’t get medications as directed by a doctor for illnesses such as diabetes, epilepsy, and tuberculosis.\n\n\n\nICE’s Cibola County facility has had 44 confirmed COVID cases since it started testing in 2020. The total number of infections jumped from 25 in mid-January to 44 on Feb. 1. The average daily population for the facility has been about 83 since November.\n\nHowever, the UCLA School of Law’s COVID Behind Bars Data Project, which is tracking infections among detainees throughout the US, said the actual number is likely much higher than reported by ICE because testing has been limited.\n\n\"Any number ICE is reporting is an undercount because they're not testing widely,\" said Joshua Manson, a spokesperson for the UCLA project, which observed several unexplained fluctuations in the cumulative number of COVID cases and tests that ICE reports.\n\nThe project gave ICE an F grade on its “data reporting and quality” scorecard.\n\nSince ICE started testing for the virus, there have been 40,358 confirmed cases across all detention facilities, according to the agency's own numbers. As of Monday there were 1,001 active cases.\n\nAnother Haitian asylum-seeker, Fristzner, who declined to give his full name because he doesn't want to jeopardize his pending case, said he also struggled to receive medical care in ICE detention as he tried to get released.\n\nIn 2015, the 32-year-old lost his right eye in a stabbing after participating in a protest against a local politician in Haiti. The men who attacked him were sent by the politician, he said. Fristzner moved to other parts of the island nation, but bandits, who control much of Haiti, would always threaten him. After being attacked again in 2017 by armed men inside his home, he left Haiti.\n\nFristzner tried to live in Chile, but said the racism and lack of immigration status made it difficult for Black immigrants. A group of men once beat and robbed him on the street while making racist comments, he said. So, like thousands of other Haitians in South America, Fristzner made the treacherous journey to the US–Mexico border last summer. Along the way, he crossed 10 countries and passed through the Darién Gap jungle, a route that UNICEF calls one of the most dangerous routes in the world, where Fristzner said he saw dead bodies as he made his way north.\n\nEventually, Fristzner joined thousands of Haitians who crossed the border into Del Rio, Texas, in search of asylum, only to be forced to wait for days in squalid conditions underneath a bridge. After being processed and taken into ICE custody in September 2021, Fristzner said he started to worry that the area where his eye used to be was infected. To make matters worse, he said, he also experienced a severe decrease in his overall vision with his left eye and worried he was going to completely lose his ability to see.\n\nIn ICE detention, Fristzner said, he couldn't read his Bible, make phone calls, or do other basic tasks without help because of his vision loss. Bowman, who also took him on as a client, said ICE initially refused to release him because it said he was a threat to public safety, despite having no criminal record and no immigration history in the US.\n\nFristzner said he submitted at least 15 requests to see a doctor to no avail. Meanwhile, with each passing day, his vision worsened and he grew more anxious.\n\n“I only have one eye,” Fristzner said. “How am I supposed to live if I can’t see with it?”\n\nHe believes his eye got infected from the days he spent under the bridge in Del Rio. He tried calling Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center in El Paso for pro bono representation — but, like most organizations working with immigrants, it is overwhelmed and people seeking help aren’t able to get through. Still, Fristzner continued to leave messages.\n\n“One time I called at night when everyone was asleep and I prayed to God to please help me,” he said. “The next morning, an official told me I had a legal visit from them.”\n\nBowman was eventually able to start pressuring ICE and get him released, but only after the agency fielded inquiries from a reporter and member of Congress. Fristzner is now living with his sister in Indiana.\n\nHe was later diagnosed with glaucoma, a condition that typically results in slow vision loss because the nerve connecting the eye to the brain is damaged. Still, he hopes to one day go to school and looks forward to completing his asylum case.\n\n“I’m with my family now and doing a lot better,” he said. “But I keep thinking about my friends in detention who are sick and can’t get out. I think of them because I know they’re suffering a lot.”","source":null},{"_id":{"$oid":"625c4df9ceb2b567b3df84e5"},"feed_source":"BuzzFeed News","title":"These Photos Show What It's Like For 500,000 Ukrainians Fleeing Russia's Invasion","link":"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/katebubacz/russia-invasion-ukraine-refugees-photos","published":"Tue, 01 Mar 2022 13:25:07 -0500","author":"Pia Peterson","summary":"Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is only four days old, but already 500,000 Ukrainians have become refugees, according to the United Nations Refugee Agency.\nUkrainians are fleeing by foot, train, and car to reach neighboring countries.\nMany are enduring lengthy journeys, crowding, and lines at train stations and borders, with limited access to food and shelter.\nWith European countries welcoming many of the refugees, people were quick to call out the stark differences in the treatment of Ukrainian refugees to that of Afghan and Syrian refugees, who have frequently experienced racism.","published_parsed":[2022,3,1,18,25,7,1,60,0],"authors":[{"name":"Kate Bubacz"},{"name":"Pia Peterson"}],"tags":["russias","welcoming","train","photos","ukraine","ukrainian","fleeing","500000","invasion","refugees","syrian","united","countries","ukrainians","treatment"],"comments":null,"content":"Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is only four days old, but already 500,000 Ukrainians have become refugees, according to the United Nations Refugee Agency.

They had gathered their things and were already scanning news reports and social media to see what was unfolding. It was jarring to see them there, having spent the previous evening celebrating a good reporting week with cocktails and steaks. Before turning in and because I had used up all my reporter’s notebooks, I visited a stationery shop, where a young girl pleaded with her mother to buy her a pen with a teddy bear on it.\n\nIt was the last normal thing I remember experiencing before the bombs went off.\n\nIn a video carried by Russian state-run television and shared widely across social media, Putin announced that a military operation was underway to force the Ukrainian government to surrender control to him. Very quickly we realized that missile strikes were being launched on strategic military installations across the country — from eastern Kharkiv to western Ivano-Frankivsk to central Uman — and the scale of Putin’s invasion became terrifyingly clear.\n\nBy midday, the casualties were piling up. Among the first to be killed was a young boy. A woman just riding a bicycle down the street was also killed. And there were many more Ukrainian civilians and troops killed. Thursday night, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said at least 137 Ukrainians had been killed so far in the Russian invasion, including both civilian and military casualties.\n\nUkrainians I’d interviewed and friends I’ve made over more than a decade of living and working here frantically called and sent texts asking for information and advice. Where was it safe to be? What was going to happen? When would it be over? Unable to provide them with sufficient answers, I felt completely useless.\n\nOn the country’s industrial eastern steppe, where a shooting war has simmered for eight years, in the capital, Kyiv, with its golden-domed monasteries and cobblestone streets, and in the pastoral west near the border of Poland and the European Union, black plumes of smoke filled the sky, each a mark of Putin’s hatred toward Ukraine.\n\nThe country was on fire.\n\nA defiant Zelensky declared martial law and ordered the country’s armories open to “all patriots” willing to defend freedom and democracy against tyranny and terrorism.\n\nBy nightfall, it was unclear how things would turn out. An unknown number of Ukrainians sought safety in bomb shelters created after World War II that nobody ever thought they would need to use. And the fighting raged on.\n\nIn a sign that perhaps the tide could turn in Ukraine’s favor, the military managed to retake control of the Hostomel Airport, where earlier in the day 34 attack helicopters swooped in from across the border and dropped off Russian forces just 15 minutes from Kyiv.\n\nSomewhere near the capital, though, the thuds of artillery could still be heard, suggesting another long, sleepless night.","source":null},{"_id":{"$oid":"625c4dfdceb2b567b3df84eb"},"feed_source":"BuzzFeed News","title":"Thousands Of Russians, Including Celebrities, Are Risking Being Arrested To Protest Putin's Invasion Of Ukraine","link":"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/juliareinstein/russian-protest-ukraine-invasion","published":"Mon, 28 Feb 2022 03:25:05 -0500","author":"Julia Reinstein","summary":"Russian protesters have been gathering in the streets to speak out against their government's invasion of Ukraine on Thursday, despite the likelihood of being arrested for doing so.\nThe demonstrations — which have broken out in dozens of cities across Russia — sought to condemn Russian President Vladimir Putin for launching the attack that has caused thousands of Ukrainians to flee their homes and put millions more at deadly risk.\nOn Thursday afternoon, hours after Ukrainian residents awoke to the sounds of missiles falling as the military invasion began, Russia's Investigative Committee released a statement warning citizens not to participate in demonstrations \"associated with the tense foreign policy situation.\"\nThe federal office added that those who chose to protest risked \"severe punishment,\" including possible imprisonment.","published_parsed":[2022,2,28,8,25,5,0,59,0],"authors":[{"name":"Julia Reinstein"}],"tags":["putins","thousands","celebrities","arrested","warning","ukrainians","ukraine","vladimir","ukrainian","tense","invasion","russian","protest","including","demonstrations","russians","risking"],"comments":null,"content":"Russian protesters have been gathering in the streets to speak out against their government's invasion of Ukraine on Thursday, despite the likelihood of being arrested for doing so.\n\nThe demonstrations — which have broken out in dozens of cities across Russia — sought to condemn Russian President Vladimir Putin for launching the attack that has caused thousands of Ukrainians to flee their homes and put millions more at deadly risk.\n\n\n\nOn Thursday afternoon, hours after Ukrainian residents awoke to the sounds of missiles falling as the military invasion began, Russia's Investigative Committee released a statement warning citizens not to participate in demonstrations \"associated with the tense foreign policy situation.\" The federal office added that those who chose to protest risked \"severe punishment,\" including possible imprisonment.","source":null},{"_id":{"$oid":"625c4e00ceb2b567b3df84ec"},"feed_source":"BuzzFeed News","title":"Russia Has Invaded Ukraine, Threatening The Safety Of Millions","link":"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/christopherm51/russia-invades-ukraine","published":"Fri, 25 Feb 2022 17:45:43 -0500","author":"David Mack","summary":"KRAMATORSK, Ukraine — Europe was plunged into its gravest crisis in decades early Thursday as Russia defied international law and threats of devastating economic sanctions by mounting a deadly full-scale invasion of Ukraine, threatening the safety of millions and sending citizens across the country scrambling for refuge as missiles fell from the sky.\nShelling and explosions struck all parts of the country, far beyond the front lines in eastern Ukraine, signifying a dramatic escalation of Russia’s 2014 invasion.\nThe Russian military claimed to have destroyed more than 80 Ukrainian military sites, including 11 airfields, Maj.

The US placed trade restrictions on one of Esquel’s Xinjiang-based subsidiaries in July 2020, and in January 2021 banned all cotton from Xinjiang, both times citing concerns about forced labor.\n\nBut Hugo Boss and other apparel brands kept sourcing clothes from other Esquel companies based in Guangdong, southern China, and importing them to the United States to sell. Procurement records and company statements reviewed by BuzzFeed News show that Esquel’s Guangdong branch works together with its Xinjiang-based cotton spinning factories, and Esquel’s own public statements make clear that its Xinjiang cotton production is deeply intertwined with its worldwide clothing operation.\n\nSince the ban against all cotton began, at least 17 Esquel shipments have arrived in the US for Hugo Boss, according to Panjiva shipping records.\n\nHugo Boss did not reply to a question about why it changed its supplier list, and Esquel did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Throughout this time, they said, moderators reviewing English-language content have been allowed to cycle through the office in three-month rotations.\n\n“Being in the office … has been nothing short of a nightmare,” one moderator said.\n\nBuzzFeed News spoke to three members of Genpact’s so-called Mexican market team who described a pattern of inequitable treatment of Spanish-language moderators. All of these individuals spoke on the condition of anonymity as Genpact requires them to sign nondisclosure agreements and they feared for their jobs. They said that in addition to reporting to the office for the last nine months while their English-language counterparts could work from home, Spanish-language moderators are held to unrealistic performance standards and are not compensated for working in two languages, which they say is more time-consuming. In addition, they face the pressures of managing a Facebook market that has long been criticized as under-moderated amid the threat of active COVID cases.\n\nGenpact spokesperson Danielle D’Angelo declined to comment on all of the specific claims made by Spanish-language moderators, including the claim that its Mexican market team was not allowed to work from home while other teams were rotated out.\n\n“We would like to stress that employee safety is our top priority and that has and will remain so throughout the COVID-19 pandemic,” D’Angelo said. “Any return to office decisions that are made in alignment with client needs are done with best safety and health practices in place and in accordance with local regulations. In all of our workplace locations, including our Richardson, TX office, we follow best-in-class safety standards, which includes frequent antigen testing.”\n\nOn Thursday, managers at Genpact’s Richardson site reportedly told company agents that it has scrapped plans to reopen at 50% capacity on Jan. 31 due to the Omicron variant. Spanish-language moderators said this change does not affect them, and they will continue reporting to the office. Genpact declined to comment on when it intends to reopen, and at what capacity.\n\nIn late June, Genpact leadership sent an email to one of the English-language moderation groups allowed to rotate out of the office, thanking them for their \"continued dedication and responsiveness.\" The email said they would return to working from home on July 26.\n\nSpanish-language moderators told BuzzFeed News they received no such email. Days after English-language moderators were told they could go back home, “[managers] told us we were a specialized queue, and that our job could not be done outside of the office,” one moderator said, noting that the Mexican market often involves moderating a deluge of particularly graphic content. Facebook declined to comment on the complaints of its Spanish-language moderators, referring BuzzFeed News to Genpact — a strategy it has taken time and again when addressing the concerns of people who make their living moderating Facebook content.\n\nSince returning to the Richardson office, employees have grown increasingly fearful for their safety. Moderators told BuzzFeed News that 30 COVID cases were reported to staff by management in December, and that no updates have been communicated since then. Meanwhile, workers say their colleagues continue to test positive for COVID, citing two cases on one floor last week. Genpact declined to comment on the number of COVID cases in its office or how frequently it reports these cases to staff.\n\nOn Dec. 22, a dozen Spanish-language moderators left the office en masse after learning through the grapevine that a sick colleague may have exposed them to the virus. Since workers claim that Genpact does not currently offer its moderators paid sick leave, they used PTO to self-isolate. Genpact declined to comment on whether its moderators are provided paid sick leave.\n\nDespite being named for the Mexican market, this team reviews Facebook and Instagram content posted in Spanish by users across most of Latin America as well, moderators said. As of 2018, there were 84 million Facebook users in Mexico, and tens of millions more using WhatsApp. In Latino and Spanish-speaking communities, Facebook has been a powerful vector of misinformation, shaping the public’s perception of topics such as COVID, election politics, and Black Lives Matter. But researchers studying misinformation told the Guardian that compared to English-language posts, harmful content posted in Spanish is removed less frequently.","source":null},{"_id":{"$oid":"625c4e13ceb2b567b3df84f3"},"feed_source":"BuzzFeed News","title":"Hugo Boss And Other Big Brands Vowed To Steer Clear Of Forced Labor In China — But These Shipping Records Raise Questions","link":"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/alison_killing/xinjiang-forced-labor-hugo-boss-esquel","published":"Wed, 19 Jan 2022 19:44:03 -0500","author":"Megha Rajagopalan","summary":"In January 2021, US regulators banned all Xinjiang cotton from entering the US, again citing forced labor.\nEsquel’s own public statements make clear that its Xinjiang cotton production is deeply intertwined with its worldwide clothing operation.\nGuangdong Esquel, along with other Esquel companies, is still listed as a supplier in Hugo Boss’s most recently published supplier list.\nIn response to a list of questions, Esquel said it had never used and would never use coerced or forced labor.\nResearch shows that forced labor in the region is not restricted to factory work — there is also evidence of forced labor in cotton picking in southern Xinjiang.","published_parsed":[2022,1,20,0,44,3,3,20,0],"authors":[{"name":"Alison Killing"},{"name":"Megha Rajagopalan"}],"tags":["supply","companies","clear","shipping","esquel","guangdong","steer","factories","raise","labor","xinjiang","company","cotton","hugo","records","questions","vowed","forced"],"comments":null,"content":"Forced labor is so pervasive in China's far west region of Xinjiang — and government control over information is so absolute — that it is nearly impossible to establish if forced labor is being used in supply chains there.

The company describes itself as “vertically integrated,” meaning that it owns factories for each stage of the cotton supply chain: Esquel’s gins separate cotton fibers from seeds, and those fibers are later spun into yarn in Esquel’s spinning mills. Esquel’s Guangdong factories knit and weave cotton yarn to make cloth, then use this to manufacture clothing that can be exported to the rest of the world via the Hong Kong–based Esquel Enterprises. The company owns at least two cotton ginning companies in Xinjiang, where the bulk of China’s cotton is grown — but makes no public reference to owning any cotton ginning facilities outside the region.\n\nSince the US ban against all Xinjiang cotton began last January, at least 16 Esquel shipments have arrived in the US for Hugo Boss, trade records show, the latest one in mid-December. One shipment has arrived addressed to PVH, the parent company of Tommy Hilfiger, containing Tommy Hilfiger–branded goods; four for Ralph Lauren; and one for Polo, a Ralph Lauren subsidiary. Guangdong Esquel, along with other Esquel companies, is still listed as a supplier in Hugo Boss’s most recently published supplier list. PVH had included Guangdong Esquel on its supplier list, as well as Esquel subsidiaries in Vietnam and Sri Lanka, but in late December — after BuzzFeed News reached out for comment — PVH released an updated version of its list, and no Esquel subsidiaries were on it. No Esquel companies appear in Ralph Lauren’s latest list, which was published in November.\n\nHugo Boss said in a statement that it had contacted Esquel, and the company had replied that “all our specifications and standards, including the observance of human rights and fair working conditions, have been and are being complied with.” Hugo Boss also said its own audits at Esquel production facilities revealed no evidence of the use of forced labor.\n\nPVH and Ralph Lauren did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nIn response to a list of questions, Esquel said it had never used and would never use coerced or forced labor. It added that it follows all national import and export laws, and that it does not sell products banned in specific jurisdictions.\n\nAsked what regions it sources cotton from other than Xinjiang, Esquel did not give any specifics, saying only that it sources from “most of the key cotton producing countries globally.”\n\nThe Esquel shipments raise questions not only about whether these brands continue to sell products that use cotton grown in Xinjiang but also about whether the US ban is truly enforceable.\n\n“Cotton is grown in Xinjiang, but then it is sold to warehouses, processors, and suppliers all over China,” said Laura Murphy, professor of human rights and contemporary slavery at Sheffield Hallam University, who has conducted research on forced labor in Xinjiang. And then it moves on as raw cotton or as yarn and fabric to the rest of the world. “Every time it moves, its provenance is increasingly obscured. There are many ways to track it, but so far most companies don’t seem invested in knowing where their raw cotton comes from.”\n\nA Customs and Border Protection spokesperson told BuzzFeed News that under US law, importers must take “reasonable care” in ensuring their supply chains are free of forced labor. Asked what constitutes “reasonable care,” the spokesperson said companies are encouraged to “become familiar with applicable laws and regulations” and work with the agency to protect consumers from “harmful and counterfeit imports.”\n\nAs part of its campaign targeting Muslims, the Chinese government has put in place labor programs in which Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities are made to work on farms and in factories. The US has labeled the campaign a genocide and has applied increasing pressure on the Chinese government, including a diplomatic boycott of the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics. The US has continued to escalate trade prohibitions during that time: The US banned cotton and tomato imports from the region in January 2021, but last month Congress passed a law mandating that all goods from Xinjiang must be stopped at the border on suspicion that they are made with forced labor, placing the burden of proof on importers.\n\nThe region has long been a top source of cotton for international companies. China is currently the world’s leading producer of cotton, with over 87% of that coming from Xinjiang. Research shows that forced labor in the region is not restricted to factory work — there is also evidence of forced labor in cotton picking in southern Xinjiang.\n\nThe Xinjiang cotton ban has become a flashpoint in the larger diplomatic row between the US and China, with the Chinese government, along with Chinese consumers and celebrities, pressuring international clothing brands to continue sourcing in the region as a show of patriotic support.\n\nHuman rights groups welcomed the ban but were skeptical it could be fully enforced. They say forced labor by Uyghurs and other mostly Muslim minority groups, underpinned by government programs, is so widespread in Xinjiang that it’s nearly impossible for any companies that source there to ensure their suppliers don’t use it. The political sensitivity of the issue, combined with the government’s other repressive measures targeting minority groups, has made it even more difficult for foreign companies to audit their supply chains.\n\nThe Better Cotton Initiative, an industry group that promotes sustainability by auditing its supply chains, stopped its reviews in Xinjiang altogether in October 2020, citing “an increasingly untenable operating environment.” Five firms did the same.\n\nEsquel is the world’s largest maker of woven cotton shirts, providing major brands with more than 100 million every year, earning the company more than $1.3 billion in yearly revenue. Esquel operates two cotton ginning mills in Xinjiang and three spinning mills, where cotton is spun into yarn. BuzzFeed News was able to geolocate the three spinning mills in Xinjiang and the garment factories in Guangdong, matching images of these facilities on Esquel’s website with satellite imagery and street-level imagery from Baidu Total View and confirming their locations. The book Esquel produced to celebrate the company’s 40th anniversary describes how its spinning mill in Xinjiang’s Turpan prefecture was established specifically to supply the Guangdong factories. By 2018, the book adds, Esquel’s investment in Xinjiang amounted to $100 million, including charitable donations. The company did not answer a question about whether that supply route has changed.","source":null},{"_id":{"$oid":"625c4e16ceb2b567b3df84f4"},"feed_source":"BuzzFeed News","title":"Novak Djokovic Has To Leave Australia After His COVID Vaccine Exemption Visa Was Canceled","link":"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/davidmack/novak-djokovic-australian-airport-visa-canceled","published":"Thu, 06 Jan 2022 18:25:13 -0500","author":"David Mack","summary":"But, as Melbourne’s Age newspaper first reported, it was not clear whether Djokovic had brought sufficient evidence to prove his exemption reason.\nTennis Australia and officials in Victoria, where Melbourne is located, made similar requirements for players who wanted to participate in the Open without first undertaking a mandatory 14-day quarantine.\nBut Australian immunization officials had outlined some temporary vaccine exemptions for its citizens, which include people who have had a PCR-confirmed case of COVID in the last six months.\nIt is not clear if these apply to foreigners seeking to enter Australia, but tennis officials had pointed to these exemptions in their decision to allow Djokovic to participate.\nOn Wednesday, Morrison’s government indicated that they would have a say on whether Djokovic would be allowed into the country.","published_parsed":[2022,1,6,23,25,13,3,6,0],"authors":[{"name":"David Mack"}],"tags":["australia","vaccination","vaccinated","visa","covid","officials","exemption","australian","leave","vaccine","canceled","minister","novak","tennis","djokovic","open"],"comments":null,"content":"Djokovic’s beliefs and behavior have made headlines throughout the pandemic.

In October 2021, he said that questions about his vaccination status were “inappropriate.”\n\nThe tournament’s defending champion had surprised many Tuesday when he posted on social media that he had been granted an “exemption permission” to travel to Australia.

If he's refusing to get vaccinated, he shouldn't be allowed in,” former Australian Medical Association vice president Stephen Parnis wrote on Twitter.\n\nAsked about the tennis player’s exemption at a press conference on Wednesday, Prime Minister Scott Morrison told reporters Djokovic would need to \"provide acceptable proof\" for his claim that he couldn’t be vaccinated for medical reasons.\n\n\"We await his presentation and what evidence he provides us to support that,\" Morrison said. \"If that evidence is insufficient, then he won't be treated any different to anyone else, and he'll be on the next plane home.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Morrison’s government indicated that they would have a say on whether Djokovic would be allowed into the country.\n\n“While the Victorian Government and Tennis Australia may permit a non-vaccinated player to compete in the Australian Open, it is the Commonwealth Government that will enforce our requirements at the Australian border,” Home Affairs Minister Karen Andrews said in a statement titled “Australia’s border rules apply to everyone.”\n\n“No individual competing at the Australian Open will be afforded any special treatment,” Andrews said.\n\nHunt, the health minister, said the rules were tough but fair. \"Australians have had to do it tough,\" Hunt said, \"and Australians in many different states and territories have had to show their vaccination records in some cases to enter premises and cafés and other things, and it's not unreasonable to have exactly the same requirement for all who enter this country.\"","source":null},{"_id":{"$oid":"625c4e1bceb2b567b3df84f5"},"feed_source":"BuzzFeed News","title":"Photos Show A Year Of Catastrophic Events Due To Climate Change","link":"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/piapeterson/climate-change-2021-photos","published":"Wed, 29 Dec 2021 13:21:28 -0500","author":"Pia Peterson","summary":"If you think that the pandemic is dragging on forever, prepare yourself for our climate change future.\nThis year felt like one major disaster followed on the heels of another, with heat waves, hurricanes, fires, floods, and freezing weather all contributing to a deadly year — and the death toll has been alarmingly undercounted.\nConcerns over resources, particularly water, are mounting as drought in the West continues.\nAction from the government to address climate change remains stalled and limited.\nWe looked back at the year in climate change and the disasters that are getting worse and more frequent as our world is altered by climate-polluting fossil fuels.","published_parsed":[2021,12,29,18,21,28,2,363,0],"authors":[{"name":"Pia Peterson"}],"tags":["climate","events","change","catastrophic","photos","west","water","worse","toll","world","waves","undercounted","weather"],"comments":null,"content":"If you think that the pandemic is dragging on forever, prepare yourself for our climate change future.

It’s impossible to do both. But this scientific reality has been an elephant in the room of high-level international climate negotiations for years — until now.\n\n“It’s significant,” Helen Mountford, a vice president at World Resources Institute, told reporters. “We’ve never had a text like that before.”\n\nStill, this new declaration isn’t final, has no timeline or other details, and comes along with some murky country-specific pledges. This incongruity on coal captures the central tension playing out at the high-profile climate talks in Glasgow: the glaring gaps between what countries must do to halt the worsening climate crisis, what countries say they will do in the future, and what they are actually doing now.\n\n“We’ll see if that text sticks,” Mountford later said. “We’re hoping it will. It’s a really important and concrete action that countries can take to actually deliver on their commitments.”\n\nOutside the climate negotiations, protesters pushed for the language to stay in. According to the Washington Post, they chanted: “‘Fossil fuels’ on paper now” and “Keep it in the text.”\n\nEven United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres expressed frustration with the negotiations on Thursday, saying that country-level “promises ring hollow when the fossil fuel industry still receives trillions in subsidies, as measured by the IMF. Or when countries are still building coal plants.”\n\nWith current climate policies in place, the world is on track to warm more than 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) this century compared to preindustrial levels. Even the most up-to-date tallies of current pledges for future climate action put the world on track to heat up 1.8 degrees Celsius. This means that even if all the countries actually deliver on their most ambitious promises — a big if — we’ll still overshoot the key Paris goal by 0.3 degrees. This may seem like a minor difference, but the science is abundantly clear that every tenth of a degree is disastrous for humanity: more frequent and intense heat waves, droughts, hurricanes, and wildfires; more sea level rise; and, ultimately, more suffering.\n\nThe science is also clear that coal is just awful for the climate. Coal is the most carbon-intensive energy source, responsible for about 40% of carbon emissions tied to global fossil fuel use.\n\nThat’s why a growing number of officials are saying that ditching coal is among the most important steps to take for tackling climate change. Just last week, for example, Canadian environment and climate change minister Steven Guilbeault said in Glasgow: “Ending emissions of coal power is one of the single most important steps we must take to meet the goals of the Paris climate agreement and the 1.5 degree target.”","source":null},{"_id":{"$oid":"625c4e25ceb2b567b3df84fc"},"feed_source":"BuzzFeed News","title":"Amazing Photos Of Airport Reunions After The Coronavirus Pandemic Separated Families","link":"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/piapeterson/airport-reunions-covid-restrictions-lifted-photos","published":"Fri, 12 Nov 2021 00:22:38 -0500","author":"Pia Peterson","summary":"Seth Wenig / APTil Wagenaar greets her son, Joost Wagenaar, after she flew from the Netherlands at Newark Liberty International Airport in Newark, New Jersey, on Nov. 8, 2021.\nTil has not been to see her son in two years, and this trip will be the first time she can meet her 1-year-old grandchild.","published_parsed":[2021,11,12,5,22,38,4,316,0],"authors":[{"name":"Pia Peterson"}],"tags":["newark","separated","trip","families","til","pandemic","netherlands","wagenaar","photos","nov","seth","airport","reunions","coronavirus","wenig","meet","son","amazing"],"comments":null,"content":"Seth Wenig / AP\n\nTil Wagenaar greets her son, Joost Wagenaar, after she flew from the Netherlands at Newark Liberty International Airport in Newark, New Jersey, on Nov. 8, 2021.

As Katitza Rodriguez, policy director for global privacy at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, noted, the language is “broad enough to encompass a wide range of potential data streams — which, even if not being collected today, could start being collected tomorrow without necessarily notifying users, securing additional consent, or amending the policy.”\n\nBy necessity, virtual reality hardware collects fundamentally different data about its users than social media platforms do. VR headsets can be taught to recognize a user’s voice, their veins, or the shading of their iris, or to capture metrics like heart rate, breath rate, and what causes their pupils to dilate. Facebook has filed patents concerning many of these data collection types, including one that would use things like your face, voice, or even your DNA to lock and unlock devices. Another would consider a user’s “weight, force, pressure, heart rate, pressure rate, or EEG data” to create a VR avatar. Patents are often aspirational — covering potential use cases that never arise — but they can sometimes offer insight into a company’s future plans.\n\nMeta’s current VR privacy policies do not specify all the types of data it collects about its users. The Oculus Privacy Settings, Oculus Privacy Policy, and Supplemental Oculus Data Policy, which govern Meta’s current virtual reality offerings, provide some information about the broad categories of data that Oculus devices collect. But they all specify that their data fields (things like “the position of your headset, the speed of your controller and changes in your orientation like when you move your head”) are just examples within those categories, rather than a full enumeration of their contents.\n\nThe examples given also do not convey the breadth of the categories they’re meant to represent. For example, the Oculus Privacy Policy states that Meta collects “information about your environment, physical movements, and dimensions when you use an XR device.” It then provides two examples of such collection: information about your VR play area and “technical information like your estimated hand size and hand movement.”\n\nBut “information about your environment, physical movements, and dimensions” could describe data points far beyond estimated hand size and game boundary — it also could include involuntary reaction metrics, like a flinch, or uniquely identifying movements, like a smile.\n\nMeta twice declined to detail the types of data that its devices collect today and the types of data that it plans to collect in the future. It also declined to say whether it is currently collecting, or plans to collect, biometric information such as heart rate, breath rate, pupil dilation, iris recognition, voice identification, vein recognition, facial movements, or facial recognition. Instead, it pointed to the policies linked above, adding that “Oculus VR headsets currently do not process biometric data as defined under applicable law.” A company spokesperson declined to specify which laws Meta considers applicable. However, some 24 hours after publication of this story, the company told us that it does not “currently” collect the types of data detailed above, nor does it “currently” use facial recognition in its VR devices.\n\nMeta did, however, offer additional information about how it uses personal data in advertising. The Supplemental Oculus Terms of Service say that Meta may use information about “actions [users] have taken in Oculus products'' to serve them ads and sponsored content. Depending on how Oculus defines “action,” this language could allow it to target ads based on what makes us jump from fear, or makes our hearts flutter, or our hands sweaty.","source":null},{"_id":{"$oid":"625c4e28ceb2b567b3df84fe"},"feed_source":"BuzzFeed News","title":"How The Pandemic Severed One Of Southern Africa’s Main Economic Lifelines","link":"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/markophiri/zimbabwe-cross-border-traders-pandemic","published":"Tue, 09 Nov 2021 00:11:02 -0500","author":"Marko Phiri","summary":"The United Nations has estimated that the industry makes up 40% of the $17 billion trade market among the 16 countries in the Southern African Development Community.\nNearly 70% of traders in Zimbabwe are women, according to the UN, and they’ve had to find other sources of income.\nSome have tried buying and selling goods domestically, for less profit.\nSome have partnered with smugglers who sneak across the border to move products, taking a cut of the revenue.\nWhen the pandemic hit, she suddenly had piles of shirts, pants, and socks in her house but no one to sell to.","published_parsed":[2021,11,9,5,11,2,1,313,0],"authors":[{"name":"Marko Phiri"}],"tags":["severed","zimbabwe","southern","michele","goods","border","pandemic","economic","south","lifelines","main","selling","trade","africas","work","traders"],"comments":null,"content":"Before the borders closed, Michele, 31, made a modest income buying clothes and electronics in South Africa and reselling them for profit across the border in Zimbabwe. But when the pandemic shut down most traffic between the two countries, she said, her revenue dried up and she had to try “other means to earn a living.”\n\nThousands of other cross-border traders in southern Africa face the same dilemma. For decades, this informal commercial network has provided steady work for people, mostly women, in the area’s borderlands. The United Nations has estimated that the industry makes up 40% of the $17 billion trade market among the 16 countries in the Southern African Development Community. But the pandemic has kicked down this essential economic pillar for communities where job opportunities are slim and there is limited access to COVID-19 vaccines, sparking a financial downturn with no end in sight.\n\nNearly 70% of traders in Zimbabwe are women, according to the UN, and they’ve had to find other sources of income. Some have tried buying and selling goods domestically, for less profit. Some have partnered with smugglers who sneak across the border to move products, taking a cut of the revenue. Some, like Michele, have begun selling sex, boarding, and companionship to the truck drivers stuck in town for weeks due to shipping delays, COVID screening bottlenecks, and confusion over shifting government policies.\n\nOne trucker has been staying with Michele at her small home in Beitbridge, Zimbabwe, for two weeks while awaiting clearance to get back on the road to transport goods as far as the Democratic Republic of Congo, a 15-hour drive. She prepares meals and a warm bath for him each day.\n\n“This is life — what can we do?” said Michele, who requested partial anonymity because she didn’t want to publicize her current work situation. “I don’t want to think ahead. I work with what I have at the moment.”\n\nBeitbridge, a trucking hub with a busy port along the Limpopo River, and other border towns have long offered opportunities for upward mobility through a bustling transnational trade network, which brought an infusion of South African currency, the rand, whose value has been more stable than the Zimbabwe dollars weakened from years of hyperinflation. But with that trade network restricted, those communities’ economic engine is sputtering.\n\n“The virus and the resultant lockdown happened so fast that the women did not have enough time to prepare for any economic repercussions,” said Ernest Chirume, a researcher and member of the Catholic University of Zimbabwe’s Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences, who wrote a paper on the effects of COVID-19 on informal traders.\n\nBefore the borders closed, Marian Siziba, 40, bought large appliances such as refrigerators, four-plate stoves, and solar panels from South Africa for resale to small downtown shops in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe’s second-biggest city. For months, she was able to make ends meet from her service selling foreign currency and issuing small loans, providing her with a trickle of payments from customers with ongoing debts. Lately, though, many of her clients have been unable to meet their dues.\n\nBefore the coronavirus, “we had already gotten used to economic hardships,” she said. “Only now it is worse because we cannot work.”\n\nFadzai Nyamande-Pangeti, a spokesperson for Zimbabwe’s International Organization for Migration, noted that the pandemic pummeled informal cross-border trade harder than other sectors. But in the absence of government relief, financial setbacks that once seemed temporary to Michele, Siziba, and other cross-border traders now feel indefinite.\n\nThe transportation challenges have widened wealth inequalities. Either people have the means to get around border restrictions or they don’t.\n\nNyasha Chakanyuka runs a popular clothing boutique in Bulawayo and said that the road closures haven’t hindered her sales because she has long relied on air travel, which most traders who spoke to BuzzFeed News said they couldn’t afford. In fact, the situation offered her an opportunity to expand her business: she has been buying up bulk inventory in other countries and selling goods to traders unable to travel out of Zimbabwe.\n\nOthers have turned to transporters who cross the land border illegally. “You can give someone that you trust money for them to buy goods for you in South Africa, but that demands extraordinary trust because the risks are obvious,” Siziba said.\n\nThose who can’t afford to pay others to move their goods for them have had to find other ways to make ends meet while awaiting a return to business as usual.\n\nAdapting to the new circumstances, Getrude Mwale, a trader in Bulawayo and a mother to five children, began selling clothes at the gate of her home, though business has been so slow that it has taken her a year to clear inventory she was once able to clear within a month.\n\n“Selling from home means you are only selling to people who know you from the neighborhood,” Mwale said. “It hasn’t been easy.”\n\nBefore the pandemic, Sarudzai, who is 33 and requested partial anonymity to keep her work situation private, traveled as far as Malawi to buy children’s clothing that she sold at a flea market in Masvingo, Zimbabwe, earning the equivalent of thousands of US dollars each year.\n\nWhen the pandemic hit, she suddenly had piles of shirts, pants, and socks in her house but no one to sell to. With her business stalled, she decided to move to Beitbridge.\n\nShe sells samosas, fries, and soft drinks, but much of her income these days comes from transactional relationships selling sex and companionship to truck drivers who stay with her in the one-room wooden home she rents. She now earns enough money to send her two children back to school in Masvingo, where they remain, nearly 200 miles away from their mother.\n\n“I always knew truckers have money — that’s why I made it here,” she said.\n\nThe Pulitzer Center helped support reporting for this story.","source":null},{"_id":{"$oid":"625c4e29ceb2b567b3df84ff"},"feed_source":"BuzzFeed News","title":"A Data Sleuth Challenged A Powerful COVID Scientist.

Then–US president Donald Trump promptly proclaimed that the finding could be “one of the biggest game changers in the history of medicine.”\n\nBut the study seemed off to Elisabeth Bik, a scientist turned science detective living in Silicon Valley. Bik has a sharp eye for spotting errors buried in arcane scientific papers, particularly when it comes to duplicated images. And much about Raoult’s paper looked fishy, as she later noted on her blog. Unfavorable data was left out, and the trial’s timeline was mathematically impossible. “Something does not seem quite right,” she wrote.\n\nBefore long, Bik would learn the price of raising such concerns. Raoult and a coauthor went on to call her a “witch hunter,” a “mercenary,” and a “crazy woman” on Twitter and in the press. Then, in April 2021, Raoult’s collaborator announced that they had filed a criminal complaint against Bik and a spokesperson for PubPeer, a website where she and others post scientific criticism, accusing them of blackmail, extortion, and harassment. He tweeted out a screenshot of the complaint, revealing her home address to the world.\n\nThese were the most direct threats Bik had ever received for identifying problems in scientific research — an activity she sees as integral to science. Alarmed, she tweeted a plea: “I could use some legal help.”\n\nTens of thousands of discoveries about the coronavirus have been made over the last two years, launching countless debates about policy and behavior. How deadly is the virus? Who should wear masks and where? How well do the vaccines fend off infections? But to find the right answers, studies must be accurate, verifiable, and responsibly done. Do a paper’s numbers add up? Are the images real? Did the scientists do the experiment they describe doing, follow ethical standards, minimize bias, and properly analyze their results?\n\nThe answer to all these questions, even before the pandemic, was: not as often as you might think. And COVID has made science’s frequent inability to police itself a clear problem with incredibly high stakes.\n\nBecause as vital as error detection is to keeping the whole enterprise honest, those who do it say there is no individual upside. No one pays them to comb through papers for mistakes. On the other hand, it’s a great way to make enemies fast. “It pisses people off,” said Nick Brown, a fellow data sleuth who cut his teeth exposing sloppy food-marketing research in 2017.\n\nBik’s efforts to clean up science are immense: Since 2014, she’s contributed to the retractions of at least 594 papers and 474 corrections. But Raoult is a daunting adversary. He’s authored thousands of papers and heads a leading infectious disease research institute in France. And during the pandemic, he has become one of the world’s biggest champions of hydroxychloroquine. His Twitter following has swelled to over 850,000, more than twice that of France’s health minister. His institute’s YouTube videos, many of which feature him, have been viewed 96 million times.\n\nThe legal threat against Bik came at a highly vulnerable time for her. Two years ago, she quit her biotech industry job to be a full-time scientific misconduct investigator, piecing together a living from consulting, speaking fees, and Patreon donations. Within the scientific community, where fact-checking almost universally happens on one’s own time and dime, Raoult’s move to press charges was a clear warning.\n\n“We support the work needed to investigate potential errors and possible misconduct and believe the scientific community can do more to protect whistleblowers against harassment and threats,” said a letter in support of Bik signed by more than 2,000 researchers and 30 scholastic organizations in May. They aren’t wrong to worry: More recently, other scientists have also sent legal threats Bik’s way.\n\nScience watchdogs have always worked alone on the periphery of the research enterprise. The pandemic is laying bare how vulnerable — and vital — they are.\n\n“I’m convinced there is a chilling effect,” Bik told BuzzFeed News. “I’m feeling the cold, too.”","source":null},{"_id":{"$oid":"625c4e30ceb2b567b3df8500"},"feed_source":"BuzzFeed News","title":"The World Is On Track To Warm 3 Degrees Celsius This Century.

In such a brutally hot world, scientists agree, deadly heat waves, massive wildfires, and damaging downpours will come far more often and hit much harder than they do today. The ocean will be hotter too and more acidic, causing fish declines and likely the end of coral reefs. In fact, a quarter or so of the Earth’s species may go extinct in such conditions or be headed that way. Our coastlines would be reshaped, a consequence of sea levels rising foot after foot, century after century, drowning places like Charleston, South Carolina’s Market Street, downtown Providence, Rhode Island, and the Space Center in Houston. All of this, as climate scientist Daniel Swain of the University of California, Los Angeles, put it, would be bad: “Bad for humans. Bad for ecosystems. Bad for the stability of the Earth systems that we humans depend on for everything.” Experts can’t say exactly how likely this future is because that depends on what humankind does to mitigate the worsening climate crisis, especially over the coming decade. But for world leaders gathering this weekend in Glasgow for the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26), this future may well become an inevitability if they don’t agree to more aggressive and immediate measures to limit greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n“Bad for humans. Bad for ecosystems. Bad for the stability of the Earth systems that we humans depend on for everything.”\n\nThe collective global goal under the Paris climate agreement is to prevent rising global temperatures from increasing no more than 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit), with no more than 1.5 degrees (2.7 Fahrenheit) as ideal. But currently, we’re on track for almost double that — a potentially catastrophic 3 degrees. “I fear that without science-based policy, and that most ambitious target being achieved, we will be facing a 3-degree-Celsius world by later this century,” Kim Cobb, a climate scientist at Georgia Tech and one of the authors on the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report, told BuzzFeed News. “It’s almost unimaginable, frankly.” So, what might 3 degrees Celsius of warming look like?\n\nFor one, our world will be much hotter than today. George Rose / Getty Images The water level at Lake Tahoe has fallen below its natural rim, dropping more than 3 feet and shutting off the flow of water down the Truckee River as seen on Oct. 17 in South Lake Tahoe, California.\n\nThe starting point for measuring future warming isn’t today — it’s the late 1800s, when reliable global temperature records started becoming available. More than a century later, the planet has already warmed a little more than 1 degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit) due to the accumulation of fossil fuel pollutants such as carbon dioxide and methane in the atmosphere. That’s an average, but some places have already gotten much warmer. Adding 2 more degrees to the more than 1 degree we’ve already added would make our world much hotter and disproportionately hotter on land. Here’s why: About 70% of the planet is covered in water, and water warms more slowly than land. “If the whole world is warmed by 3 degrees Celsius,” Swain explained, “all of the land area has to warm by a lot more than that.”\n\n“It’s almost unimaginable, frankly.”\n\nThat would likely be about 1.5 degrees Celsius warmer on average over land, or collectively 4.5 degrees, according to Zeke Hausfather, a climate scientist and energy systems analyst at the Breakthrough Institute. And it will likely be even hotter in the Arctic, which is already warming roughly three times the rate of the rest of the planet. One way to envision what this might look like in the places in which we live is to consider the projected number of days where the local temperature hits or exceeds 95 degrees Fahrenheit (35 degrees Celsius). Earlier this century, Arizona experienced roughly 116 days of such high temperatures, Texas experienced about 43 days, Georgia about 11 days, Montana approximately 6 days, and Massachusetts just 1 day, according to modeling by the Climate Impact Lab. Were global temperatures to rise by an average of 3 degrees Celsius by 2100, those numbers would spike to an estimated range of 179 to 229 days of at least 95 degrees Fahrenheit days in Arizona, 135 to 186 days in Texas, 85 to 143 days in Georgia, 46 to 78 days in Montana, and 26 to 66 days in Massachusetts, per the same analysis.\n\n​​Disasters will multiply. Michael Hanson / AFP via Getty Images A sign gives directions to a cooling center at Kellogg Middle School in Portland, Oregon, on Aug. 14.\n\nJust this summer, the Northwest Pacific heat wave brought Death Valley–like temperatures to British Columbia, Oregon, and Washington, killing hundreds of people in an event that scientists agree would have been “virtually impossible” without climate change. Then a record-setting downpour dropped about 9 inches in the middle of Tennessee, killing about two dozen people. And last weekend, more than 5 inches dropped in a day in California’s capital city of Sacramento, setting a new record. “What I think about is, what would the shocking event be in a 3-degree-warmer world?” Swain said. It’s impossible to know the answer exactly. But the general contours of what it could look like are already clear: even more common and intense extreme heat events and similarly more frequent and intense downpours, even in places that are expected to get drier in such a world. This is true for almost anywhere on the planet. “There are very few places on Earth that are not going to see an increase in the maximum precipitation intensity,” Swain said, adding that there are “very likely zero places that are not going to experience an increase in the most extreme hot days.”\n\nPete Bannan / MediaNews Group via Getty Images Warren Montgomery attempts to make his way across a road in Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania, following historic flooding from the storm system that was Hurricane Ida.\n\nStatistics from the latest IPCC report support this. What was considered a 1-in-10-year extreme heat event, such as a heat wave, in the late 1880s would be more than 5.6 times likely to occur in a 3-degrees-warmer world. The outcome could be higher power costs due to an explosion of air-conditioning, which could trigger power supply problems. Those without access to cooling could suffer more heat sickness. And then there’s the issue of water shortages; together with ongoing heat waves, they could spur massive crop failures. Likewise, what was previously considered a 1-in-10-year extreme precipitation event over land would be more than 1.7 times likely to occur. These types of disasters have historically caused washed-out roads, flooded homes and businesses, and knocked-out power lines. Meanwhile, regional disasters will also increase in frequency and intensity. Think more prolonged droughts and bigger wildfires along the West Coast and more powerful hurricanes along the Gulf Coast and East Coast. Worse, a phenomenon called “compounding disasters\" could mean such events hit in rapid succession or simultaneously. A recent example of this was Louisiana’s Lake Charles, which suffered through multiple federally declared disasters in a year: back-to-back hurricanes, including a devastating Category 4 storm, followed by a winter storm and then intense flooding.\n\nNickolay Lamm / Courtesy Climate Central A rendering of the National Mall with 3 degrees of global warming\n\nIn a 3-degrees-warmer world, the coastlines of today will largely be gone, endlessly reduced over the coming centuries by rising seas. By the end of 2100, sea levels are expected to rise by about 2 feet on average. That would be near catastrophic for small island nations. Most of Maldives, large swaths of the Bermuda archipelago, and some of Seychelles island, including its airport, could be underwater. So, too, could large parts of Thailand’s capital of Bangkok, home to more than 5 million people; the Netherland’s Amsterdam, the Hague, and Rotterdam cities, which are, combined, home to about 2 million people; and much of the US Gulf Coast, including sections of big cities like New Orleans and Texas’s Galveston. These examples are based on mapping by the research group Climate Central, whose projections do not account for current or future defenses constructed to counter rising water levels.\n\n“An estimated 12% of the current global population living on land could be threatened.”\n\nWater will continue rising next century and the one after. So jumping to 2,000 years in the future, Robert Kopp, a climate scientist at Rutgers University, expects water levels to be somewhere between 13 feet to more than 30 feet above current levels. That much water, assuming there are no defenses in place against the rising levels, would likely inundate parts of California’s Bay Area and Los Angeles and reconfigure much of the Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida coasts, according to Climate Central mapping. “An estimated 12% of the current global population living on land could be threatened under long-term future sea level rise under the 3 degrees Celsius scenario,” said Scott Kulp, a principal computational scientist at Climate Central. “So that amounts to 810 million people.” The projection to 2100 doesn’t account for the possibility of the world’s ice sheets rapidly melting, and even the longer-term estimates don’t assume a total rapid collapse, although it’s possible. “The more we push the system above 2 degrees Celsius — but we don’t know how much — the more the chance we trigger ice sheet processes that could rapidly increase sea level rise,” Kopp explained in an email.\n\nThe terrifying unknown. David Mcnew / Getty Images A chaparral brush landscape is charred by the Alisal fire on Oct. 13 near Goleta, California.\n\nPerhaps the most frightening thing about a 3-degrees-warmer world is an uncertainty about how it would impact the way our natural so-called carbon sinks — think plants and trees, soil, and even the ocean — regularly and consistently pull carbon dioxide out of the air. If any one of these sinks were to stop absorbing as much carbon, more carbon would linger in the atmosphere, fueling global warming.\n\n“We certainly can’t rule out a 4-degree-warmer world.”","source":null},{"_id":{"$oid":"625c4e31ceb2b567b3df8501"},"feed_source":"BuzzFeed News","title":"These Photos Show The Timeless Appeal Of Travel And Tourism","link":"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/piapeterson/photos-travel-photography-history","published":"Thu, 30 Sep 2021 13:16:02 -0400","author":"Pia Peterson","summary":"Under lockdown, travel photography fueled our jealousy, longing, and admiration.\nAn upcoming exhibit looks at the museum’s extensive collection of travel and tourism images through the years.\nLilyan Jones is the project cataloger for the Alden Scott Boyer Collection at the Eastman Museum.\nWorking with the museum’s photography collection, she goes through over 13,000 items that were given to the museum, some of which range from the very beginning of photography to the 1950s.\n“There are a lot of early views of Egypt, people climbing the pyramids; there's also early views of India and Japan and even Niagara Falls.”","published_parsed":[2021,9,30,17,16,2,3,273,0],"authors":[{"name":"Pia Peterson"}],"tags":["early","collection","tourism","eastman","travel","photography","museum","timeless","photos","jones","yorkan","views","appeal","museums"],"comments":null,"content":"Under lockdown, travel photography fueled our jealousy, longing, and admiration.

But, to date, no related charges have been filed. Calls and emails sent to the DOJ and FBI officials named in the leaked appeal went unanswered. The US Embassy in Kyiv also declined to comment. The FBI and DOJ spokespeople each said they do not confirm or deny the existence of an ongoing investigation.\n\nDuring extradition hearings in Kyiv over the past year, Lang has denied involvement in the Florida killings and said federal authorities are going after him because of his political views and extremist ties. Four of the six sources, including Kennedy and Kleman, said they believed the DOJ’s focus now is getting Lang extradited to the US, something Irina Venediktova, Ukraine’s prosecutor general, told BuzzFeed News this month that she would also like to see happen. “We did our homework [on Lang],” she said, noting that she approved the US request for extradition last year. (The European Court of Human Rights ordered a stay on Lang’s extradition until it reviewed his case. The court had not yet made a decision when this article was published.) In May, the US government said during a court hearing that it would waive the death penalty for Lang in order to speed up the process.\n\nLang didn’t respond to a request for comment. His Ukrainian lawyer, Dmytro Morhun, declined to respond directly to the DOJ investigation and claims made against Lang, saying he would only do so if presented with evidence of alleged crimes, not assumptions of law enforcement agencies. He said the US investigation was proof of what he has argued since Lang was detained in Ukraine — that the US efforts to bring him back home were political in nature and are “connected precisely with his participation in the armed forces of Ukraine in the east, while fighting against the Russian aggressor.”\n\nIn interviews in person and by phone, Kennedy, Kleman, Plaster, and Boyenger confirmed they had fought in Ukraine, but they all denied the allegations that they committed or aided any possible war crimes and said they were never part of Right Sector; the four served with the regular Ukrainian military and provided documentation showing they did. Rickert didn’t respond to messages seeking comment, and Pirtle couldn’t be reached. But a family member of Pirtle’s told BuzzFeed News by phone that Pirtle spoke to the FBI at least twice about his experience once he left Ukraine and returned home to San Jose. The family added that Pirtle is currently serving in the US Army and is based in Louisiana. An Army spokesperson confirmed Pirtle is an active-duty infantryman with no combat deployments who has served since October 2020.\n\nThousands of foreign fighters have flocked to eastern Ukraine to join a war that Russia incited in spring 2014 — using troops in unmarked uniforms and local separatist proxies — that has killed more than 14,000 people. Venediktova told BuzzFeed News that her office is investigating 250 foreign fighters from 32 countries for war crimes. All of them have fought with Russia-led forces.\n\nVenediktova said that, for now, there are no active investigations into foreign fighters who joined the Ukrainian side. But Gyunduz Mamedov, the deputy prosecutor general of Ukraine, said in an interview in Kyiv in August that after learning of the US war crimes probe in 2019, he considered opening his own into Lang’s alleged crimes. “I thought that a proper legal assessment of the situation should be done in Ukraine as well,” he said, adding, “My main concern was [Lang’s] crimes in Ukraine.” Mamedov said he asked US authorities to share the evidence used to build their case against Lang and the other Americans. “Unfortunately,” he said, “there has been no response.”\n\nRoughly 40 other Americans have fought on the Ukrainian side, according to BuzzFeed News’ reporting and expert research. Many are veterans or men who had hoped to join the US military but couldn’t, and wanted to help a democratic ally in its fight against Russia’s aggressive authoritarianism. Others are opportunists who see a shot at a once-in-a-lifetime adventure and a fresh start. And several are combat enthusiasts who hop from war to war.\n\nBut some are far-right extremists who have set their gaze on Ukraine, a place that has become a destination and training ground for such types in the West. As far-right extremism has risen in the US, so has the interest among American white supremacists in militarized right-wing Ukrainian groups that have had success in growing and mainstreaming their organizations and movements. They include violent neo-Nazis like those from the Rise Above Movement who have gone to Ukraine to meet and train with some of the groups — and then export what they learned to the US.","source":null},{"_id":{"$oid":"625c4e31ceb2b567b3df8503"},"feed_source":"BuzzFeed News","title":"Immigrants Who Escaped The Texas Camp Crackdown Are Facing Another Set Of Dire Circumstances In Mexico","link":"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/adolfoflores/immigrants-mexico-stuck-fear-deportation","published":"Sun, 26 Sep 2021 02:09:15 -0400","author":"Hamed Aleaziz","summary":"“I’d like to stay here in Mexico, but I’m scared because I don’t have permission to be here, Wood told BuzzFeed News.\nOn Thursday before dawn, Mexican immigration agents drove into the camp flanked by local police and the National Guard.\nThe immigrants, most of them Haitian, who had been living at a park in Ciudad Acuña, were startled awake.\nThe Biden administration has moved thousands of immigrants from the Del Rio area to other parts of the border, to be processed into the country or removed.\nIn a matter of days, the US flew almost 2,000 immigrants back to Haiti.","published_parsed":[2021,9,26,6,9,15,6,269,0],"authors":[{"name":"Adolfo Flores"},{"name":"Hamed Aleaziz"}],"tags":["mexican","agents","set","border","rio","thousands","dire","camp","circumstances","del","facing","texas","haiti","crackdown","mexico","immigrants","escaped"],"comments":null,"content":"The 35-year-old father weighed his options: head back into the US, where he could be sent back to Haiti, or stay in Mexico as authorities closed in around him and other immigrants.\n\nWood, who declined to give his full name out of fear of retaliation from the US or Mexico for speaking out, said he didn’t have a plan but needed to form one if he’s to take care of his wife and two daughters.\n\n“I’d like to stay here in Mexico, but I’m scared because I don’t have permission to be here, Wood told BuzzFeed News. \"But the US may deport us.

It has relied, in large part, on the Title 42 policy, which cites the pandemic as the reason for allowing border agents to quickly turn back asylum-seekers, to clear the camp in Del Rio of thousands of Haitians. In a matter of days, the US flew almost 2,000 immigrants back to Haiti. On Friday, more flights were expected to the country, which has been struggling following an earthquake and presidential assassination.","source":null},{"_id":{"$oid":"625c4e32ceb2b567b3df8504"},"feed_source":"BuzzFeed News","title":"These Pics Of Angela Merkel Covered In Birds Are Now A Meme And It's Sehr Gut","link":"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/davidmack/angela-merkel-birds","published":"Wed, 15 Dec 2021 23:02:29 -0500","author":"David Mack","summary":"Angela Merkel was on the campaign trail on Friday, two days before Germans head to the polls to elect a new parliament and thus her replacement.\nThe 67-year-old is retiring after almost 16 years as German chancellor, but she is still out campaigning for her center-right Christian Democratic Union party.\nOn Friday, she made a surprise visit to the northern state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, where she visited a bird park in the town of Marlow.\nThere, while holding some bird feed, she posed with some colorful Australian rainbow lorikeets.","published_parsed":[2021,12,16,4,2,29,3,350,0],"authors":[{"name":"David Mack"}],"tags":["gut","birds","state","angela","merkel","visited","union","pics","covered","trail","retiring","replacementthe","surprise","visit","bird","town","sehr","meme"],"comments":null,"content":"Angela Merkel was on the campaign trail on Friday, two days before Germans head to the polls to elect a new parliament and thus her replacement.\n\nThe 67-year-old is retiring after almost 16 years as German chancellor, but she is still out campaigning for her center-right Christian Democratic Union party.\n\nOn Friday, she made a surprise visit to the northern state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, where she visited a bird park in the town of Marlow.\n\nThere, while holding some bird feed, she posed with some colorful Australian rainbow lorikeets.","source":null},{"_id":{"$oid":"625c4e32ceb2b567b3df8505"},"feed_source":"BuzzFeed News","title":"How A Mission To Turn A Haitian Town Into A Surfing Destination Failed To Live Up To Its Promise","link":"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/karlazabludovsky/haiti-surfing","published":"Wed, 22 Sep 2021 00:09:23 -0400","author":"Karla Zabludovsky","summary":"Gilles’s parents, like so many others, had told him if he plunged in he might drown.\nThere wasn’t much to do in town except to play soccer on the beach or horse around on scraps of plastic in the water.\nAs Pierce later recounted, he kept looking over his right shoulder at the waves, looking for the right one — until, at last, he found it near Kabic Beach.\nWithin months, Pierce had rented a house on Kabic Beach, imported more boards, and started teaching local kids to surf.\nHe started Surf Haiti, a nonprofit organization, intended to establish the country as a surfing destination and provide jobs for people in the community.","published_parsed":[2021,9,22,4,9,23,2,265,0],"authors":[{"name":"Karla Zabludovsky"}],"tags":["near","destination","wasnt","right","started","pierce","failed","surfboard","rubble","looking","haitian","live","promise","mission","water","turn","surfing","surf","town"],"comments":null,"content":"At first, he was afraid of the sea.\n\nGilles’s parents, like so many others, had told him if he plunged in he might drown.

There wasn’t much to do in town except to play soccer on the beach or horse around on scraps of plastic in the water.

Pierce, an emergency physician, was among the legion of volunteers who streamed into the country. He brought a suitcase full of medical supplies — and a surfboard, just in case.\n\nAfter settling in, he took a drive down the coast near Jacmel, a cultural hub that resembles a worn-down New Orleans, with some buildings boasting high ceilings, vivacious colors, and wrap-around verandas. Painters and sculptors in the city used rubble from pancaked buildings to make art. As Pierce later recounted, he kept looking over his right shoulder at the waves, looking for the right one — until, at last, he found it near Kabic Beach.\n\nWhen he paddled back to shore, a group of local boys was waiting for him, bursting with questions, and a request to try his board out.

They also mentioned the urgent need to administer doses to unvaccinated people worldwide to save lives and prevent the emergence of more dangerous variants.\n\nThe review comes as the US nears the Biden administration's controversial proposed start date for a booster rollout, recommended eight months after an individual's second shot of the Pfizer or Moderna COVID-19 vaccines. The report also comes one week after the White House announced a massive push to mandate vaccination among nearly two-thirds of the US workforce, as pockets of unvaccinated individuals continue to drive high numbers of hospitalizations and deaths nationwide.\n\nThe FDA's external panel of experts is holding a highly anticipated meeting this Friday to discuss Pfizer's application for a booster dose.\n\nThe 18 coauthors of the Lancet review include Marion Gruber, the director of the FDA’s vaccines office, and Philip Krause, her deputy at the agency, both of whom announced they would be resigning in the fall, reportedly in part due to their opposition to the Biden administration's booster plan. The review was also coauthored by several experts at the World Health Organization, which has called for a global booster shot moratorium in order to maximize vaccinations worldwide — especially in developing countries, where vaccination rates remain very low.\n\nThe Lancet paper reviews the current evidence on the protection offered by existing vaccines. While the vaccines all offer less protection against infection with the Delta variant compared with the previously dominant Alpha, they still offer very good protection against severe disease. And while the ability to prevent infection or even symptomatic illness may decrease over time, protection against severe disease appears so far to hold strong.\n\nThree CDC reports published last week confirmed these findings across most age groups, declining more significantly in people 75 or older. One of the studies reviewed nearly 570,000 US COVID-19 cases from April to July, showing that unvaccinated people were nearly 5 times more likely to get infected, and more than 10 times as likely to be hospitalized or die compared to people who received a vaccine.\n\n\"Current evidence does not, therefore, appear to show a need for boosting in the general population, in which efficacy against severe disease remains high,\" the authors of the Lancet paper wrote.\n\n\n\nData out of Israel, which has already begun a rollout of booster shots, showed an increase in protection against infection and severe disease after a third shot of the Pfizer vaccine, which was originally given in two doses. But the Lancet authors noted that the data was only collected for a week after the booster dose was administered, and it's unclear how long that protection will last.\n\nThe Lancet authors argued that boosters may ultimately be needed if immunity wanes over time, but more research was needed to determine when that will be necessary. For now, they argued, there is a more urgent need to administer existing doses among the unvaccinated. They also suggested that booster doses designed specifically against the main circulating variants of the coronavirus might be more powerful and longer lasting.\n\n\"Even if some gain can ultimately be obtained from boosting, it will not outweigh the benefits of providing initial protection to the unvaccinated,\" the authors wrote. \"If vaccines are deployed where they would do the most good, they could hasten the end of the pandemic by inhibiting further evolution of variants.\"\n\n\n\nMike Ryan, head of the WHO's Health Emergencies Program, condemned booster shot rollouts in stark terms last month. \"We're planning to hand out extra life jackets to people who already have life jackets, while we're leaving other people to drown without a single life jacket,\" Ryan said. \"That's the reality.\"","source":null},{"_id":{"$oid":"625c4e33ceb2b567b3df8507"},"feed_source":"BuzzFeed News","title":"Prince Andrew Has Been Served With A Sexual Abuse Lawsuit By Jeffrey Epstein Accuser Virginia Giuffre","link":"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ellievhall/prince-andrew-served-sexual-assault-lawsuit-giuffre","published":"Fri, 10 Sep 2021 21:15:51 -0400","author":"Ellie Hall","summary":"Prince Andrew, Duke of York, has been served with a sexual assault lawsuit filed against him by one of Jeffrey Epstein's accusers, according to New York federal court records.\nShortly after the interview aired, Andrew announced that he was \"stepping back\" from royal public duties.\nThe head of security refused to allow Sepulveda to serve Andrew in person.\nBuzzFeed News reached out to Bloxsome for comment on the affidavit of service and the document's claim that his security team had been instructed not to receive court documents.\nIt is unclear whether lawyers representing Andrew will participate at all, as no documents have been filed in federal court in his defense.","published_parsed":[2021,9,11,1,15,51,5,254,0],"authors":[{"name":"Ellie Hall"}],"tags":["court","security","bloxsome","virginia","sepulveda","accuser","lawsuit","royal","team","andrew","york","service","epstein","sexual","documents","jeffrey","giuffre","prince","served"],"comments":null,"content":"Prince Andrew, Duke of York, has been served with a sexual assault lawsuit filed against him by one of Jeffrey Epstein's accusers, according to New York federal court records.\n\nAndrew is being sued in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York by Virginia Giuffre, 38, who alleges the duke sexually abused her on multiple occasions in New York, London, and on Epstein's private island in the US Virgin Islands between 2000 and 2002 when she was under the age of 18.\n\nThe duke has repeatedly denied having sex with Giuffre, most notably in a disastrous November 2019 BBC interview in which he attempted to defend himself, claiming to have never met her.

Nine months later, she keeps checking Facebook Messenger for a response from her father, Hector Dilamar Silva Borges. His absence has hovered over her young life. For three years, she and her mother, Phanie, waited for their child support case to move through Haiti’s courts. Then in December, more than two years after the UN confirmed Borges is Jui’s father through a DNA test, a judge issued an unprecedented ruling, ordering him to pay $3,590 per month, a landmark decision with the potential to impact families around the country with similar cases.\n\nJessica Obert for BuzzFeed News Jui and her mother, Phanie\n\nUN peacekeepers fathered dozens of children while they were stationed in Haiti between 2004 and 2017, often with women they were providing money and food to — behavior UN policy “strongly discouraged” because of the “inherently unequal power dynamics.” Initially deployed in response to a coup attempt and the ousting of former president Jean-Bertrand Aristide, their force grew following the catastrophic 2010 earthquake. But none stayed long, and when their rotations ended, they abandoned their babies, leaving behind a generation of children born into a nation struggling to rebuild, with limited access to food, schooling, and healthcare. Calls for the UN to dispatch new peacekeepers echoed across the world after the July assassination of President Jovenel Moïse threatened to send the country into turmoil — and before a 7.2 magnitude earthquake hit the southern coast in August, killing more than 2,200 people and destroying entire towns. For some of the women in Haiti still seeking support from the peacekeepers who swept in a decade ago, the possibility of a new influx of them triggered resentment. All but one of their claims for child support from UN peacekeepers have stalled in Haiti’s courts. Lawyers representing the women said the UN and the peacekeepers’ home nations are withholding some of the documents needed to move forward, and that judges are reluctant to rule against an international institution or countries that are supplying Haiti with critical resources, including funding, training, and jobs that offer a path out of the country — or a handsome salary. In response to questions for this story, a UN spokesperson told BuzzFeed News that the organization has a zero tolerance policy for sexual exploitation and abuse, and said it engages with local communities to encourage individuals to come forward if they have claims, including through the recent distribution of 6,000 flyers on the issue in Port-au-Prince. The spokesperson said that the ruling in favor of Jui was “very important” and that the UN was ready to cooperate further with national authorities. Uruguay’s office in charge of overseeing peacekeeper training and liaising with the UN, the Uruguayan National System in Support of Peace Operations, told BuzzFeed News that it has not received a notification about the ruling against Borges and that the country’s judicial system “does not permit in absentia convictions.” The law firm representing Phanie and Jui, Port-au-Prince-based Bureau des Avocats Internationaux, initiated child support claims from UN peacekeepers on behalf of nine other families in 2017. It’s unclear how many such cases remain pending in Haiti’s courts. “I had crossed my fingers to get this ruling because if there’s one, we will get more,” said Mario Joseph, the firm’s managing attorney. “It will open doors in other courts.” Yet even that hope was limited. As of August, eight months after the ruling, Jui and Phanie have yet to receive a single dollar from Borges, who remains an active member of the Uruguayan navy and did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nMario Tama / Getty Images A United Nations soldier keeps watch as earthquake survivors gather outside a food distribution point Feb. 8, 2010, in Port-au-Prince, Haiti.\n\nSince 1948, the signature blue helmets of UN peacekeepers have become common sights at the scenes of devastation and turmoil around the world. Those who don the organization’s uniform are typically members of their home nation’s military, which the UN reimburses with a fee for every person it enlists. Presenting themselves as an independent force that feeds the hungry and intervenes in genocides, peacekeepers developed credibility in most of the world as something of a moral compass for the global age. But evidence of abuse on several missions in recent years has tarnished their reputation, perhaps nowhere more than in Haiti, where peacekeepers were in charge of building shelters and distributing food after the earthquake on Jan. 12, 2010, killed more than a quarter-million people and flattened much the country. Even as aftershocks continued to rumble, some peacekeepers began trading food for sex in the tent cities that sprang up to house the hundreds of thousands of displaced families and in the areas around the UN bases. “I tried to point fingers as much as I could and sound the alarm,” said Lina AbiRafeh, a women’s rights activist who coordinated the UN gender-based violence response following the 2010 earthquake. She received reports of abuse and exploitation frequently and “acted on each report, through every channel available” but UN officials didn't take them seriously or investigate them in a timely manner, she said. Abuse and exploitation became common. Peacekeepers began “going to the beach, acting like tourists, drinking, chasing girls,” according to a study published last year by Stability: International Journal of Security and Development. Two of the study’s authors, Sabine Lee and Susan Bartels, oversaw a 2017 survey of approximately 2,500 Haitians. Of those, 265 said they had a child with a UN peacekeeper or knew of someone who did. Nearly half of the UN peacekeepers reported in the survey were from Uruguay and Brazil. Of the 120 reports of sexual abuse or exploitation the UN says it has received in Haiti since 2007, it has opened 88 investigations and sent home 41 uniformed personnel, according to the organization’s database. Of those, 12 have spent an undisclosed amount of time in jail in their home countries, nine have been kicked out of their country’s military, and two have faced financial sanctions at home. The problem of peacekeepers sexually abusing or exploiting local women is not unique to Haiti — there have been 1,143 allegations since 2007, across at least a dozen countries, according to the database. But Haiti, one of the world’s poorest countries, has endured multiple scandals, including a sex ring in which more than 130 peacekeepers from Sri Lanka exploited nine Haitian children, according to an investigation by the Associated Press. It wasn’t until 2015 that the UN began requiring peacekeepers’ home countries to certify that deployed military personnel had no prior allegations of human rights violations, according to the UN spokesperson. And it’s not just the UN: In 2011, senior staff at Oxfam GB failed to act on reports of its aid workers sexually abusing Haitian girls as young as 12. Several American missionaries have been jailed for sexually abusing children in Haiti. The private struggles of the families abandoned by UN peacekeepers take place against the larger struggles of a nation that has suffered a seemingly unending string of tragedies. Rose Mina Joseph, then 16, met Julio Cesar Posse, a 35-year-old marine from Uruguay, at a beach party in the southwestern seaside town of Port-Salut a few months after the 2010 earthquake. Posse pressured Rose Mina into sex, she said. “I didn’t have an understanding of what I was doing,” said Rose Mina during an interview at her home this month. Under Haitian law at the time, it was considered statutory rape. Shortly after, Rose Mina realized she was pregnant, and within months of her son Anderson’s birth, Posse returned home. Rose Mina depended on relatives to feed her newborn. Once, Posse gave her about $100 via a Western Union–like service. It was, she said, the only time he sent help.\n\nJessica Obert for BuzzFeed News Rose Mina Joseph and her son, Anderson Joseph\n\nPosse was a member of the Uruguayan navy until 2018, navy spokesperson Alejandro Chucarro told BuzzFeed News. Carina de los Santos, legal adviser at the Uruguayan National System in Support of Peace Operations, said “severe sanctions restricting his freedom” were imposed on Posse, but that his withdrawal from the navy was unrelated to his paternity case in Haiti. She did not specify what the sanctions entailed. Posse did not respond to a request for comment. Though the 2010 earthquake brought a range of international organizations to Haiti, their impact was often underwhelming, and at times damaging. While Anderson was still breastfeeding, cholera, introduced by Nepalese UN peacekeepers via a sewage leak at one of their bases, became an epidemic, killing at least 10,000 people and making more than 800,000 ill. At the same time, international donations for reconstruction efforts began evaporating with no explanation: With the half a billion dollars the American Red Cross raised, it built only six homes, according to an investigation by ProPublica. A highly touted $300 million industrial park inaugurated by the Clintons and Sean Penn under-delivered, creating few jobs and drawing fewer tenants. Meanwhile, the Haitian government embezzled much of a $2 billion loan from Venezuela meant to be invested in education, health and social initiatives, and infrastructure, embroiling one administration after another in graft scandals. In 2016, as Anderson prepared to enter kindergarten, Hurricane Matthew barrelled into Haiti, killing at least 1,000 people and destroying 30,000 houses along the southern coast — including his family’s. They were forced to move to a small hut along an unpaved road, a single room with cinder block walls and a corrugated tin roof. In recent months, as Anderson finished fourth grade and the country navigated the aftermath of the president’s assassination, crime has risen sharply, as gangs have taken control of key transportation routes in and out of Port-au-Prince, forcing thousands of people to move elsewhere. “Every day gets harder,” Rose Mina said in an interview this month, as she sat on the bed she and her son shared, wiping the sweat off his forehead as he napped beside her. The only object linking him to his father — a photograph of Posse — lies tucked away in a suitcase in a corner of the room. She said she only takes it out when Anderson asks where his father is.\n\nJessica Obert for BuzzFeed News Becheline Appoliner, the mother of Dominic Antonio Cortez, whose father was a UN peacekeeper from Argentina\n\nThe newborns became toddlers, and the toddlers school children. Soon, they began asking questions. Where is my father? Why don’t I look like the other kids? Dominic Antonio Cortez’s tawny skin and the 2-inch-high nest of curls on his head stood out in stark contrast to the darker complexion and buzz cuts of the other boys in the neighborhood. At school, he said, classmates whispered about him behind his back and taunted him to his face, disparagingly calling him “Little Minustah,” after the name of the UN’s mission to Haiti: MINUSTAH. “The teachers don’t like me,” he said. “Other children don’t want me in the school.” The 9-year-old said he prefers to be at home, where he sleeps on a thin mattress he shares with his two siblings in the living room and often goes to bed with an empty stomach. In a fit of anger, Dominic recently accused his mother, Becheline Appoliner, of preventing him from finding his father, and threatened to harm himself. The boy says he wants to be a UN peacekeeper when he grows up. In 2011, Appoliner met Argentine peacekeeper Marcelo Cortez as she walked to a local market in Port-au-Prince, and he invited her out to Jet Set, a nightclub popular with foreigners, she said. Soon, he was spending time with her family and sleeping over in their home. When she told him she was pregnant, Appoliner remembers him being happy, but just two months later, when his rotation ended, he left Haiti and soon after, blocked her on Facebook. Cortez did not respond to a request for comment. When Dominic was 3 months old, Appoliner said she went to one of the UN offices in Port-au-Prince, desperate for some financial help. They took down her information, but they did not follow up until Dominic was 7 years old, according to Appoliner. An acquaintance living near her in 2016, aware that she was no longer able to put Dominic’s older brother through school, suggested she reach out to a certain lawyer who might be able to help.\n\nJessica Obert for BuzzFeed News Mario Joseph, a human rights lawyer and managing director of the Bureau des Avocats Internationaux\n\nSoon, Appoliner found herself sitting across from Mario Joseph in his office, in an unmarked building along one of the capital city’s narrow, winding streets. By then, Joseph, along with the US-based Institute for Justice and Democracy in Haiti, had grown accustomed to fighting the UN: They had filed a class action lawsuit in a US federal court on behalf of victims of the cholera epidemic, a case they lost when the court upheld the UN’s immunity from damages. Joseph, 58, has worked some of the country’s most emblematic human rights cases, representing victims of the Raboteau massacre and of former dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier. He grew up in a house with no electricity or running water and believes many of the injustices committed in Haiti are a result of racism and imperialism, endemic not just among the outsiders who interfere in the country, but within the Haitian government as well. He took Appoliner’s case and began putting together a file for Cortez. In August 2016, Joseph’s law firm sent legal notifications to MINUSTAH informing them that they planned to file child support suits and requesting information on the alleged fathers, including about any investigations related to paternity cases by the UN’s Conduct and Discipline Unit and the results of DNA tests, some of which had been submitted to the organization as early as 2014. The response, said Joseph, was opaque and incomplete. They did not provide details on internal investigations into the claimants’ cases or certification that the peacekeepers’ immunity did not prevent these cases from moving forward in Haitian courts. In December 2017, Joseph filed claims on behalf of 10 women in courts across Haiti.\n\n“They say they’re promoting human rights, yet they’re violating ours,” Joseph said of the UN. A UN spokesperson told BuzzFeed News that the organization has provided “documentation and information to the mothers as well as to the national authorities of Haiti,” and that 31 Haitian women and 36 children are receiving assistance that “varies in accordance to their individual needs” and includes funds for the upcoming school year. The foreign ministry, which is the entity that corresponds directly with the UN, has kept Joseph on the sidelines, he said, including holding meetings with the women without having their lawyers present. Claude Joseph, who initially took over as prime minister after Moïse’s assassination and is now serving as foreign minister, declined an interview request from BuzzFeed News. The women’s cases have largely stalled in their respective courts. Mario Joseph thinks part of the problem is that judges are reluctant to rule against the UN or its member countries because many of them have received training from the UN or are hoping to get a job there one day. During an interview, Bernard Saint-Vil, dean of the Court of First Instance in Port-au-Prince, initially said the fear of reprisals by the UN “may also be a factor” in the delay of these cases but then backtracked, saying judges must apply the law. Sitting in his office a few blocks from the National Palace, which was partially destroyed during the 2010 earthquake and never rebuilt, Saint-Vil clarified that pressure for the cases to move forward needs to come from the foreign ministry. After nearly four years, only one judge — in the case of Jui — has issued a favorable judgment for a woman filing a child support claim against a UN peacekeeper. But because it is nearly impossible to enforce the ruling in Uruguay, Joseph said that all he can do now is tell other UN member countries about the ruling in hopes they increase diplomatic pressure. Some of the women try to track down their children’s fathers themselves. On Feb. 8, 2020, Appoliner wrote to Cortez’s son, Jorge, on Facebook Messenger: “I’m an 8-year-old child. I want to meet Marcelo Antonio Cortez, my father.” The following day, Jorge wrote back: “What do I have to do with this? Find him and write [to] him.” A few weeks later, Appoliner messaged him again. “Your father had a child with me, look at the photo,” and attached a photo of Dominic. The following month, Jorge responded: “I spoke to him and he says you’re lying.”\n\nJessica Obert for BuzzFeed News Appoliner’s text exchange with Jorge, Cortez’s son\n\nAppoliner holds on to whatever hope she can. In her purse, she carries an old, weathered business card belonging to Carla Pessanha Loque, a former senior victims’ rights officer at the UN, even though she can’t remember the last time Pessanha picked up her call. Still, “I feel like it’s a support,” she said. By early August, she was behind on rent and on the verge of getting evicted.\n\nJessica Obert for BuzzFeed News The view from Omese’s apartment of Jalousie, known in the capital of Port-au-Prince for the painted homes of an overcrowded shantytown on the mountainside\n\nAbove the hills in Port-au-Prince, Jalousie looks vibrant. The slum — nestled in the middle of Petionville, an upscale neighborhood where many diplomats live in villas hidden behind tall concrete walls — was painted by the government with pastel greens, purples, and pinks in 2013 as an attempt to improve the view for the wealthy surroundings. But behind the bright walls, little was done to improve sanitation, introduce running water, or provide more electricity for residents. In a small, blue hut on one of Jalousie’s steeply sloping streets, Omése Théodore lives with her three children, each fathered by a different UN peacekeeper, she said. In 2009, Théodore was studying communications in college and taking care of her first child, a son she says is from a Cameroonian peacekeeper who had recently left the country. When the earthquake hit, she lost her home and was forced to sleep on the street for a month. With unemployment rates hovering above 50% and a toddler to raise, Théodore began “looking for someone else to help me with my child” with money for food and school. She found a Rwandan peacekeeper who offered her money “and a little something for the kid.” When he found out she was pregnant with his child, shortly after, he urged her to get an abortion, which is illegal in Haiti. A few months later and six months into her pregnancy, his rotation ended and he went home, said Théodore. The following year, Théodore met another peacekeeper, from Benin. She became pregnant, he ordered her to abort, and she refused. This time, he threatened to shoot her, she said. Théodore went to the UN base in Port-au-Prince to ask for money for her children. The organization must provide “assistance and support addressing the medical, legal, psychological and social consequences directly arising from sexual exploitation and abuse” by UN personnel, according to a document from the Office of the Victims’ Rights Advocate. But Théodore and three other women told BuzzFeed News that they have only gotten limited and intermittent monetary support, including a one-time $1,500 housing stipend and about $660 for school every year. Théodore said the organization only did DNA tests on two of her three sons, and that it has only released the results for one of those two. Through an Italy-based nonprofit, the UN sends money to help pay for her children’s food and schooling, but she said she hasn’t gotten any support since March. The UN told BuzzFeed News that it cannot address individual cases because of confidentiality issues.\n\nJessica Obert for BuzzFeed News Omése Theódore, with her children, Carl Michel Armand (left), Jacques Andre Theódore (center), and Jean Christ Theódore (right)\n\nIn recent years, the UN began to take steps to address the history of sexual exploitation among its ranks. In 2019, the UN Mission for Justice Support in Haiti organized a program in several cities in the country to raise awareness about sexual abuse perpetrated by its staff. Called “Theatre of the Oppressed,” it encouraged spectators to go onstage to offer solutions to the problem. In 2020 — over a decade after Haitian women began reporting peacekeepers’ abuse — the UN approved a trust fund for survivors of sexual exploitation by its staff in Haiti. As of June, Uruguay and Brazil, the two countries with the most reports of sexual exploitation in Haiti, had not contributed any money. The trust fund “is so poorly funded that it is an embarrassment to the UN,” said Paula Donovan, codirector of Code Blue Campaign, an organization that advocates for survivors of sexual abuse by UN personnel. She added that while the UN has encouraged troop-contributing countries to enforce child support legislation, it has stopped short of setting any requirements. “It’s simply no longer standing in the way when women make paternity claims,” said Donovan. The UN spokesperson said the organization calls “on those who fathered these children in Haiti to assume their individual parental responsibility toward them,” and that it has provided “several Haitian mothers with DNA test results.” The spokesperson added that the UN supports brokering agreements between the parents, though these are “not always possible as they depend on the cooperation of the father.” Chucarro, the Uruguayan navy spokesperson, said the country adopted “a series of measures to implement the UN’s policy of zero tolerance on sexual abuse and exploitation” in 2003, and referred BuzzFeed News to the Uruguayan foreign ministry for answers to specific questions. The Uruguayan foreign ministry did not respond to a request for information. During a recent afternoon, Théodore’s sons gathered in their living room, which was just big enough for two chairs, a dresser, and a small fridge. Jean Christ, 4, sat on his mother’s lap. Jacques Andre, who had just lost his third tooth, cheekily sang a song he heard on the radio. Eleven-year-old Carl Michel Armand held a sketchbook depicting the universe of “Macsi Puissant,” the superhero family he had created, giving each member a different power: one could make trees, another could put together robots, and a third one could muster enough electricity to power his house. Whenever they were hungry, the three boys asked Théodore to search for their fathers. The hip-height fridge was empty except for four tin containers filled with water.\n\nJessica Obert for BuzzFeed News Jui plays piano at her home.\n\nThe videos Jui posts on TikTok usually show her singing or dancing in front of a mural painted by her mother, Phanie. They come from a family of artists and art lovers. Paintings by some of Haiti’s most famous oil masters lie stacked against the walls of their home. Édith Piaf and jazz often plays in the background. Jui is learning to play the piano. But she doesn’t fantasize about becoming an artist when she grows up. Recently, Jui decided that she wants to be a nurse. She believes that when he’s older, Borges, her father, will one day fall ill, and she wants to be the one to bring him back to health. She dreams of the moment when she’s working a shift at the hospital, and she sees her dad’s name on the list of patients. She has it all planned: When that happens, she’ll ask to be his nurse, go out to buy him the medicine he needs, and then watch him feel ashamed that he did not help her. For now, the A-student studies extra hard in her science class, making sure to memorize which medicinal herbs treat what disease and how best to administer them. She takes long walks with her uncle at a nearby garden, where he teaches her about which leaves can be used to brew healing teas. Jui still possesses the one thing she has from Borges: the $120 he gave Phanie before he left a decade ago, tucked underneath her pillowcase. ●","source":null},{"_id":{"$oid":"625c4e34ceb2b567b3df850a"},"feed_source":"BuzzFeed News","title":"12 Photo Stories That Will Challenge Your View Of The World","link":"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/piapeterson/12-photo-stories-that-will-challenge-your-view-of-the-world","published":"Sun, 29 Aug 2021 22:33:33 -0400","author":"Pia Peterson","summary":"Meanwhile, Kiana Hayeri photographed young Afghans as she asked what will become of the country's post-9/11 generation for the New York Times Magazine.\nIn Somaliland, Nichole Sobecki photographed cheetah cubs in the wild and documented how they are illegally removed from their homes.\nAnd for Fast Company, researchers asked people in two towns in Colombia to photograph examples of justice and coexistence, with illuminating results.\nWe look at the winners of the Women Photograph grants, including Eli Farinago and Danielle Villasana.\nGena Marvin is reimagining Russian beauty, and Pablo Piedra, a longtime military photographer, now takes stunning photographs of bugs.","published_parsed":[2021,8,30,2,33,33,0,242,0],"authors":[{"name":"Pia Peterson"}],"tags":["challenge","series","asked","winners","york","women","photographed","photograph","young","12","afghans","photographer","world","view"],"comments":null,"content":"This week, we've been following the continued flight of Afghans from their country.

For three days, the nurse was too scared to leave her house. On the fourth morning, she received a call from the hospital’s president: “The Taliban have no problem with women,” she recalled him saying. “Please come back to work. There are tasks here that only you can do; we are strapped for resources, we need you.”\n\nThe nurse spoke with BuzzFeed News to share with readers a “real picture” of what it is like to be a working woman in Afghanistan right now, she said, requesting anonymity because she fears for her life.\n\nFor working women who remain in Afghanistan, the days since the fall of Kabul have brought fear and a chilling uncertainty about what their lives will look like under Taliban rule. For months, the Taliban have publicly claimed that they have moderated their positions on aspects of women’s rights. On Wednesday, Taliban’s spokesperson Zabiullah Mujahid told reporters in Kabul that there was only a “temporary restriction” on working women and that it was for their own safety amid the chaos of the regime change.\n\n“Our security forces are not trained [in] how to deal with women,” Mujahid said. “Until we have full security in place … we ask women to stay home.”\n\nBut the early days of the Taliban’s reign in Afghanistan have only confirmed what Afghan women have been saying all along: that their home country will once again turn into a place where women face greater dangers, restrictions, and few opportunities. Women who were once publicly outspoken about their rights have been forced to flee the country, their homes and offices ransacked by armed gunmen, and posters with images of women have been defaced across the capital. Young girls have been sent home from school and warned not to return. Hospitals like the ones the nurse works in are becoming gender segregated — women doctors and nurses can only speak to and treat other women, and all women outside their homes must wear hijab. Even in areas where the Taliban is yet to start policing women, their return to power has emboldened vigilantes who have threatened women for not wearing a hijab or not staying in their homes.\n\n\n\n“We’re just waiting now,” said the nurse, who has worked at the hospital for 10 years. “But even we don’t know what we’re waiting for.”\n\nFor women like the nurse, the only earning member in her family, going to work was never a choice but a necessity. She now dreams of leaving Afghanistan, she said, but fears that that is an impossibility because of her unique circumstances: The nurse lives with her mother and a sister with disabilities who requires constant care. Even before a bomb killed dozens of people at the Kabul airport on Thursday, the nurse said that she couldn’t imagine how she could possibly usher an elderly woman and child through the desperate crowds jostling for the limited seats on flights out of the country.\n\n“If something were to happen to my sister, or if I had to leave them behind, I would not be able to live with myself,” she said.\n\nEven though the nurse did not trust the Taliban or her hospital’s president, she returned to the hospital on Thursday out of a sense of duty, she said. On the streets, she said, there were soldiers everywhere, carrying Kalashnikovs and watching as she walked past in her hijab.\n\n“The fear was intense,” she said. “They glared at me as though I were prey. But I kept telling myself, maybe they are not like before, they do not beat women anymore. They seemed quiet, not violent. At least not yet.”\n\nAt the hospital, the security persons who usually manned each entrance were missing and the entire place seemed upside down. She walked in to find that most patient wards were empty — many had simply ripped their IVs out and left the hospital on foot. Those who remained — a few terminally ill patients, one pregnant woman — looked terrified, she said.\n\nThe COVID ward, which the nurse said was overrun with at least a dozen patients until the week before, was now empty. The nurse learned from another nurse that the relatives of some patients had decided the Taliban was a more dangerous threat than the coronavirus and had taken their sick family members home or straight to the airport.\n\n\n\n“We no longer have any data on the number of COVID patients in this hospital, or for that matter, in this city,” she told BuzzFeed News. “The health ministry is still updating COVID data, but none of that is real. No one who is sick wants to leave their house and run into Taliban soldiers.”\n\n\n\nA few stampede victims were brought to her hospital for treatment too, but they were men, whom she could not treat under the new hospital rules. The nurse said she learned about this new rule from a colleague, who told her she had been sent home by Taliban soldiers when she was seen speaking to a man with a bleeding foot.\n\nNurses and doctors are required to go to the hospital every day to log their presence in the city for the Taliban. Between the new policies and the empty wards, the nurse is having a hard time motivating herself to keep showing up to work, she said.\n\nMany patients, seeking to avoid the risk of leaving their homes, have turned to privately contacting medical professionals. The nurse recently delivered a baby when a pregnant woman showed up in her neighborhood, begging for help. The nurse carried whatever supplies she could find and walked with the woman to her home, where she delivered the baby in secret. The nurse left the woman with a list of medicines she would eventually need, but she said she has not heard from her again.\n\nThe nurse is afraid of making too many home visits because of the Taliban soldiers at checkpoints who are monitoring movement around the city, but she is not sure how else to earn money. The hospital’s president recently told nurses their salaries are on hold until the city’s banks start functioning normally again — banks in Kabul closed on Aug. 15, just before Afghanistan’s former president, Ashraf Ghani, fled and the Taliban arrived in the capital. When banks reopened after nearly a week, they were nearly impossible to enter on account of massive crowds. The nurse said she hasn’t been able to access an ATM and isn’t sure what to do if she runs out of cash. If the Taliban forces women like her to stop working, the nurse said, she will have no way to feed her family.\n\nIn her neighborhood, the nurse said that soldiers were not as much of a problem as ordinary men on the street who had suddenly appointed themselves moral guardians, telling women to go back home, wear a hijab, and show some shame, warning them of beatings if they do not comply.\n\nA few days ago, she had an argument with a shopkeeper who chastised her for regularly wearing jeans: “It’s a good thing the Taliban are here to take care of women like you,” she recalled him saying. Since then, the nurse’s mother and a young male neighbor have taken turns going out to buy bread and essentials for the family.\n\n\n\nThe nurse spends most of her time indoors now, but her primary sources of entertainment at home no longer offer any semblance of escapism — the television airs nothing but the news. “All I see are turbans, beards, and guns,” the nurse said. “No Bollywood films, Afghan Superstar, or the chat shows we used to love.” The radio, she said, no longer plays music but only the Taliban’s religious songs, which “have no melody and sound like a funeral.” ●\n\nKhatol Momand contributed reporting.","source":null},{"_id":{"$oid":"625c4e34ceb2b567b3df850c"},"feed_source":"BuzzFeed News","title":"These Photos Show The Devastating Aftermath Of The Deadly Kabul Airport Attack","link":"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/kirstenchilstrom/kabul-airport-explosions-aftermath-photos","published":"Fri, 27 Aug 2021 19:59:20 -0400","author":"Kirsten Chilstrom","summary":"Two explosions outside the Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul, Afghanistan, on Thursday left a scene of carnage and destruction, with at least 13 US service members and an unknown number of Afghan civilians killed.\nThe attacks were believed to have been carried out by an ISIS suicide bomber, US officials said, adding that they were still working to calculate \"the total loss.\"\nThe attacks only added to the chaos, panic, and fear at the airport; crowds of Afghan families have been struggling to flee Afghanistan since the Taliban took over the country.\nImages showed emergency workers and civilians rushing to help those injured by the blasts and gunfire.\nHere's a look at the aftermath of the deadly attacks:","published_parsed":[2021,8,27,23,59,20,4,239,0],"authors":[{"name":"Kirsten Chilstrom"}],"tags":["civilians","afghanistan","total","kabul","afghan","aftermath","attack","photos","working","took","devastating","workers","airport","attacks","unknown","deadly"],"comments":null,"content":"Two explosions outside the Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul, Afghanistan, on Thursday left a scene of carnage and destruction, with at least 13 US service members and an unknown number of Afghan civilians killed.\n\nThe attacks were believed to have been carried out by an ISIS suicide bomber, US officials said, adding that they were still working to calculate \"the total loss.\" The attacks only added to the chaos, panic, and fear at the airport; crowds of Afghan families have been struggling to flee Afghanistan since the Taliban took over the country.

They pointed out that Afghan nationals who work for the UN take on far greater risks in the country for less pay than their international colleagues, and their work could put them in harm’s way. Reuters reported on Tuesday that Taliban fighters had ransacked multiple UN compounds since its stunning sweep to power last week.\n\n“They are very, very visible in communities,” said a former international UN staffer who requested anonymity. “The Taliban know exactly who these people are.”\n\nThe UN did not respond to repeated requests for comment.\n\nStéphane Dujarric, the spokesperson for the secretary-general, said in an Aug. 18 press conference that the UN could not easily evacuate Afghan nationals from the country because it is “not a nation that issues visas.”\n\nHe added that the UN is doing its “utmost” for national staff and their families. “There are all sorts of administrative hurdles that have to be negotiated and discussed,” Dujarric said. “But the national staff is very much on the forefront of what we are trying to do every day.”\n\nThe organization has about 300 international staff members and 3,000 Afghan national staff in Afghanistan, working for the UN’s mission in the country as well as agencies such as the UN Development Program and UN Women. The organization said on Aug. 18 that about 100 of those international staff would temporarily leave for Kazakhstan.\n\nThe UN-focused news site PassBlue reported on Friday that Afghan nationals working for the organization felt “alone and petrified.” New details in this story about Afghan staffers pleading to no avail for help hiding from the Taliban — even as one heard word that militants were in his neighborhood asking where he was — raise further questions about whether the UN adequately planned to protect local employees as the Taliban ramped up their military offensive against the Afghan government starting in May.\n\n“They've had months to prepare for this,” the former international staffer said.\n\nOne Afghan staffer, who works in the operations department of a UN agency, said he and his colleagues repeatedly brought up the issue of evacuations in the chat box of a Zoom meeting with colleagues and superiors last week, but received no response. (BuzzFeed News is withholding identifying details of all four Afghan staffers interviewed for this article to avoid endangering them.)\n\n“They usually read the chat box,” he said. “This time they were seeing the chats but trying to change the topic and get everything finished.”\n\nThe staffer said he had asked his superiors whether the UN would help him and other Afghan staff who hold valid international visas. But he was told that the organization could try only to get him out, forcing him to leave his wife and young child behind.\n\n“How does this make sense?” he said. “How can I leave my family behind me when I leave the country? It’s not acceptable for me or for the national staff — it’s against humanitarian values, it’s against human values.”\n\nOther Afghan staff members described similar meetings.\n\n“They’re just playing a game with us. Each week there’s a meeting where they say they’re ‘trying our best,’” said another Afghan staffer for the UN Development Project who works on gender equality. “What kind of trying is this? If small embassies can evacuate staff, why can’t the UN?”\n\nIt’s unclear how many UN international staff have been moved out of Afghanistan, but the four staffers told BuzzFeed News that high-level international staff had been evacuated and that it seemed that it was mainly Afghans left.\n\nLiam McDowall, a spokesperson for the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (Unama), told PassBlue that the UN was pushing other countries to support visa applications and temporary residence requests from Afghan staff members and their families.\n\nUnama did not respond to calls or emails for this article.\n\nStaffers interviewed by BuzzFeed News also said UN officials had told them they were campaigning for visas so they could relocate to other countries, but some said they felt it was too little, too late.\n\n“This is not the time for visas,” said one Afghan staffer who works with UNDP. “We have UN identity cards, they can discuss with other countries to do an immediate evacuation.”\n\nOne UN worker who has urged the UN to evacuate its female Afghan employees out of concern about the Taliban’s abuses of women told BuzzFeed News she had requested help for Afghan staffers in town hall meetings and through local and global staff associations.\n\n“No one heard us,” she said. “No one is listening.\"\n\n“They told us we have to ‘stay and deliver,’” she added, quoting a UN slogan about its presence in Afghanistan.\n\nThe UN reportedly moved some of its Afghan staff to Kabul to reduce their risk but has not put those people in secure locations.\n\n“They haven't been housing them in a fortified compound, they’ve been left to their own devices,” said the former international staffer, who had spoken directly with Afghan staffers.\n\nThe World Bank evacuated all of its Afghan-based staff, Reuters reported on Aug. 20.\n\nA group of UN unions and staff associations began a petition calling for the UN secretary-general to take “all necessary measures” including evacuation to protect staff. It has nearly 5,300 signatures as of Tuesday afternoon.\n\n“We are supposed to protect human rights of all, and now we are leaving our own to fend for themselves,” said Arora Akanksha, a UN auditor who is campaigning to be the next secretary-general. “Shame on the UN and its leadership.”\n\n“This whole ‘stay and deliver’ message that the UN is promoting, we should ask ourselves who is staying?” she added.\n\nA Unama staffer who said he is in hiding in a remote location told BuzzFeed News Taliban militants were asking his neighbors about his whereabouts. He had worked on sensitive political projects, and he believes he could be targeted.\n\n“All the people here know I am working with Unama,” he said. “I am high profile.”\n\nHe told BuzzFeed News he asked his department to move him to a safer location where militants would have a tougher time identifying him by speaking to locals, days before Kabul fell to the Taliban. A few days later, after the militant group had already seized power, a reply came advising him to hide at home, according to emails he shared with BuzzFeed News.\n\n“I’m like a detainee,” he said. “I cannot go outside, I cannot see anyone.

That data, which runs up until February 2020, shows that police departments, prosecutors’ offices, universities, and interior ministries from around the world ran nearly 14,000 searches with Clearview AI’s software. At many law enforcement agencies from Canada to Finland, officers used the software without their higher-ups’ knowledge or permission. After receiving questions from BuzzFeed News, some organizations admitted that the technology had been used without leadership oversight. In March, a BuzzFeed News investigation based on Clearview AI’s own internal data showed how the New York–based startup distributed its facial recognition tool, by marketing free trials for its mobile app or desktop software, to thousands of officers and employees at more than 1,800 US taxpayer-funded entities. Clearview claims its software is more accurate than other facial recognition technologies because it is trained on a database of more than 3 billion images scraped from websites and social media platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, and Twitter. Law enforcement officers using Clearview can take a photo of a suspect or person of interest, run it through the software, and receive possible matches for that individual within seconds. Clearview has claimed that its app is 100% accurate in documents provided to law enforcement officials, but BuzzFeed News has seen the software misidentify people, highlighting a larger concern with facial recognition technologies. Based on new reporting and data reviewed by BuzzFeed News, Clearview AI took its controversial US marketing playbook around the world, offering free trials to employees at law enforcement agencies in countries including Australia, Brazil, and the United Kingdom. To accompany this story, BuzzFeed News has created a searchable table of 88 international government-affiliated and taxpayer-funded agencies and organizations listed in Clearview’s data as having employees who used or tested the company’s facial recognition service before February 2020, according to Clearview’s data. Some of those entities were in countries where the use of Clearview has since been deemed “unlawful.” Following an investigation, Canada’s data privacy commissioner ruled in February 2021 that Clearview had “violated federal and provincial privacy laws”; it recommended the company stop offering its services to Canadian clients, stop collecting images of Canadians, and delete all previously collected images and biometrics of people in the country. In the European Union, authorities are assessing whether the use of Clearview violated the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), a set of broad online privacy laws that requires companies processing personal data to obtain people’s informed consent. The Dutch Data Protection Authority told BuzzFeed News that it’s “unlikely” that police agencies’ use of Clearview was lawful, while France’s National Commission for Informatics and Freedoms said that it has received “several complaints” about Clearview that are “currently being investigated.” One regulator in Hamburg has already deemed the company’s practices illegal under the GDPR and asked it to delete information on a German citizen. Despite Clearview being used in at least two dozen other countries, CEO Hoan Ton-That insists the company’s key market is the US. “While there has been tremendous demand for our service from around the world, Clearview AI is primarily focused on providing our service to law enforcement and government agencies in the United States,” he said in a statement to BuzzFeed News. “Other countries have expressed a dire need for our technology because they know it can help investigate crimes, such as, money laundering, financial fraud, romance scams, human trafficking, and crimes against children, which know no borders.” In the same statement, Ton-That alleged there are “inaccuracies contained in BuzzFeed’s assertions.” He declined to explain what those might be and did not answer a detailed list of questions based on reporting for this story.\n\nClearview AI has created a powerful facial recognition tool and marketed it to police departments and government agencies. The company has never disclosed the entities that have used its facial recognition software, but a confidential source provided BuzzFeed News with data that appeared to be a list of agencies and companies whose employees have tested or actively used its technology. Using that data, along with public records and interviews, we have created a searchable database of internationally based taxpayer-funded entities, including law enforcement agencies, prosecutor’s offices, universities, and interior ministries. We have included only those agencies for which the data shows that at least one associated individual ran at least one facial recognition scan as of February 2020. The database has limitations. Clearview has neither verified nor disputed the underlying data, which The data begins in 2018 and ends in February 2020, so it does not account for any activity after that time or for any additional organizations that may have started using Clearview after February 2020. Not all searches corresponded to an investigation, and some agencies told us that their employees had merely run test searches to see how well the technology worked. BuzzFeed News created search ranges based on data that showed how many times individuals at a given organization ran photos through Clearview. We found inaccuracies in the data, including organizations with misspelled or incomplete names, and we moved to correct those issues when they could be confirmed. If we were not able to confirm the existence of an entity, we removed it. BuzzFeed News gave every agency or organization in this database the opportunity to comment on whether it had used Clearview’s technology and whether the software had led to any arrests. Of the 88 entities in this database: 36 said they had employees who used or tried Clearview AI.\n\nOfficials at 9 of those organizations said they were unaware that their employees had signed up for free trials until questions from BuzzFeed News or our reporting partners prompted them to look.\n\nOfficials at another 3 entities at first denied their employees had used Clearview but later determined that some of them had.\n\n10 entities declined to answer questions as to whether their employees had used Clearview.\n\n12 organizations denied any use of Clearview.\n\n30 organizations did not respond to requests for comment. Responses from the agencies, including whether they denied using Clearview’s technology or did not respond to requests for comment, are included in the table. Just because an agency appears on the list does not mean BuzzFeed News was able to confirm that it actually used the tool or that its officials approved its employees’ use of Clearview. By searching this database, you affirm that you understand its limitations.\n\nAccording to a 2019 internal document first reported by BuzzFeed News, Clearview had planned to pursue “rapid international expansion” into at least 22 countries. But by February 2020, the company’s strategy appeared to have shifted. “Clearview is focused on doing business in the USA and Canada,” Ton-That told BuzzFeed News at that time. Two weeks later, in an interview on PBS, he clarified that Clearview would never sell its technology to countries that “are very adverse to the US,” before naming China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea. Since that time, Clearview has become the subject of media scrutiny and multiple government investigations. In July, following earlier reporting from BuzzFeed News that showed that private companies and public organizations had run Clearview searches in Great Britain and Australia, privacy commissioners in those countries opened a joint inquiry into the company for its use of personal data. The investigation is ongoing, according to the UK's Information Commissioner’s Office, which told BuzzFeed News that “no further comment will be made until it is concluded.” Canadian authorities also moved to regulate Clearview after the Toronto Star, in partnership with BuzzFeed News, reported on the widespread use of the company’s software in the country. In February 2020, federal and local Canadian privacy commissioners launched an investigation into Clearview, and concluded that it represented a “clear violation of the privacy rights of Canadians.” Earlier this year, those bodies officially declared Clearview’s practices in the country illegal and recommended that the company stop offering its technology to Canadian clients. Clearview disagreed with the findings of the investigation and did not demonstrate a willingness to follow the other recommendations, according to the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada. Prior to that declaration, employees from at least 41 entities within the Canadian government — the most of any country outside the US — were listed in internal data as having used Clearview. Those agencies ranged from police departments in midsize cities like Timmins, a 41,000-person city where officers ran more than 120 searches, to major metropolitan law enforcement agencies like the Toronto Police Service, which is listed in the data as having run more than 3,400 searches as of February 2020.\n\nA spokesperson for the Timmins Police Service acknowledged that the department had used Clearview but said no arrests were ever made on the basis of a search with the technology. The Toronto Police Service did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Clearview’s data show that usage was not limited to police departments. The public prosecutions office at the Saskatchewan Ministry of Justice ran more than 70 searches with the software. A spokesperson initially said that employees had not used Clearview but changed her response after a series of follow-up questions.\n\n“The Crown has not used Clearview AI to support a prosecution.”\n\n“After review, we have identified standalone instances where ministry staff did use a trial version of this software,” Margherita Vittorelli, a ministry spokesperson, said. “The Crown has not used Clearview AI to support a prosecution. Given the concerns around the use of this technology, ministry staff have been instructed not to use Clearview AI’s software at this time.” Some Canadian law enforcement agencies suspended or discontinued their use of Clearview AI not long after the initial trial period or stopped using it in response to the government investigation. One detective with the Niagara Regional Police Service’s Technological Crimes Unit conducted more than 650 searches on a free trial of the software, according to the data. “Once concerns surfaced with the Privacy Commissioner, the usage of the software was terminated,” department spokesperson Stephanie Sabourin told BuzzFeed News. She said the detective used the software in the course of an undisclosed investigation without the knowledge of senior officers or the police chief. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police was among the very few international agencies that had contracted with Clearview and paid to use its software. The agency, which ran more than 450 searches, said in February 2020 that it used the software in 15 cases involving online child sexual exploitation, resulting in the rescue of two children. In June, however, the Office of the Privacy Commissioner in Canada found that RCMP’s use of Clearview violated the country’s privacy laws. The office also found that Clearview had “violated Canada’s federal private sector privacy law by creating a databank of more than three billion images scraped from internet websites without users’ consent.” The RCMP disputed that conclusion. The Canadian Civil Liberties Association, a nonprofit group, said that Clearview had facilitated “unaccountable police experimentation” within Canada. “Clearview AI’s business model, which scoops up photos of billions of ordinary people from across the internet and puts them in a perpetual police lineup, is a form of mass surveillance that is unlawful and unacceptable in our democratic, rights-respecting nation,” Brenda McPhail, director of the CCLA’s privacy, technology, and surveillance program, told BuzzFeed News.\n\nLike a number of American law enforcement agencies, some international agencies told BuzzFeed News that they couldn’t discuss their use of Clearview. For instance, Brazil’s Public Ministry of Pernambuco, which is listed as having run more than 100 searches, said that it “does not provide information on matters of institutional security.” But data reviewed by BuzzFeed News shows that individuals at nine Brazilian law enforcement agencies, including the country’s federal police, are listed as having used Clearview, cumulatively running more than 1,250 searches as of February 2020. All declined to comment or did not respond to requests for comment. The UK’s National Crime Agency, which ran more than 500 searches, according to the data, declined to comment on its investigative techniques; a spokesperson told BuzzFeed News in early 2020 that the organization “deploys numerous specialist capabilities to track down online offenders who cause serious harm to members of the public.” Employees at the country’s Metropolitan Police Service ran more than 150 searches on Clearview, according to internal data. When asked about the department's use of the service, the police force declined to comment. Documents reviewed by BuzzFeed News also show that Clearview had a fledgling presence in Middle Eastern countries known for repressive governments and human rights concerns. In Saudi Arabia, individuals at the Artificial Intelligence Center of Advanced Studies (also known as Thakaa) ran at least 10 searches with Clearview. In the United Arab Emirates, people associated with Mubadala Investment Company, a sovereign wealth fund in the capital of Abu Dhabi, ran more than 100 searches, according to internal data. Thakaa did not respond to multiple requests for comment. A Mubadala spokesperson told BuzzFeed News that the company does not use the software at any of its facilities. Data revealed that individuals at four different Australian agencies tried or actively used Clearview, including the Australian Federal Police (more than 100 searches) and Victoria Police (more than 10 searches), where a spokesperson told BuzzFeed News that the technology was “deemed unsuitable” after an initial exploration. “Between 2 December 2019 and 22 January 2020, members of the AFP-led Australian Centre to Counter Child Exploitation (ACCCE) registered for a free trial of the Clearview AI facial recognition tool and conducted a limited pilot of the system in order to ascertain its suitability in combating child exploitation and abuse,” Katie Casling, an AFP spokesperson, said in a statement. The Queensland Police Service and its homicide investigations unit ran more than 1,000 searches as of February 2020, based on data reviewed by BuzzFeed News. The department did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nClearview marketed its facial recognition system across Europe by offering free trials at police conferences, where it was often presented as a tool to help find predators and victims of child sex abuse. In October 2019, law enforcement officers from 21 different nations and Interpol gathered at Europol’s European Cybercrime Centre in the Hague in the Netherlands to comb through millions of image and video files of victims intercepted in their home countries as part of a child abuse Victim Identification Taskforce. At the gathering, outside participants who were not Europol staff members presented Clearview AI as a tool that might help in their investigations. After the two-week conference, which included specialists from Belgium, France, and Spain, some officers appear to have taken back home what they had learned and began using Clearview.\n\n“The police authority did not know and had not approved the use.”\n\nA Europol spokesperson told BuzzFeed News that it did not endorse the use of Clearview, but confirmed that “external participants presented the tool during an event hosted by Europol.” The spokesperson declined to identify the participants. “Clearview AI was used during a short test period by a few employees within the Police Authority, including in connection with a course arranged by Europol. The police authority did not know and had not approved the use,” a spokesperson for the Swedish Police Authority told BuzzFeed News in a statement. In February 2021, the Swedish Data Protection Authority concluded an investigation into the police agency’s use of Clearview and fined it $290,000 for violating the Swedish Criminal Data Act. Leadership at Finland’s National Bureau of Investigation only learned about employees’ use of Clearview after being contacted by BuzzFeed News for this story. After initially denying any usage of the facial recognition software, a spokesperson reversed course a few weeks later, confirming that officers had used the software to run nearly 120 searches. “The unit tested a US service called Clearview AI for the identification of possible victims of sexual abuse to control the increased workload of the unit by means of artificial intelligence and automation,” Mikko Rauhamaa, a senior detective superintendent with Finland’s National Bureau of Investigation, said in a statement. Questions from BuzzFeed News prompted the NBI to inform Finland’s Data Protection Ombudsman of a possible data breach, triggering a further investigation. In a statement to the ombudsman, the NBI said its employees had learned of Clearview at a 2019 Europol event, where it was recommended for use in cases of child sexual exploitation. The NBI has since ceased using Clearview. Data reviewed by BuzzFeed News shows that by early 2020, Clearview had made its way across Europe. Italy’s state police, Polizia di Stato, ran more than 130 searches, according to data, though the agency did not respond to a request for comment. A spokesperson for France’s Ministry of the Interior told BuzzFeed News that they had no information on Clearview, despite internal data listing employees associated with the office as having run more than 400 searches. “INTERPOL’s Crimes Against Children unit uses a range of technologies in its work to identify victims of online child sexual abuse,” a spokesperson for the international police force based in Lyon, France, told BuzzFeed News when asked about the agency’s more than 300 searches. “A small number of officers have used a 30-day free trial account to test the Clearview software. There is no formal relationship between INTERPOL and Clearview, and this software is not used by INTERPOL in its daily work.\" Child sex abuse typically warrants the use of powerful tools in order to save the victims or track down the perpetrators. But Jake Wiener, a law fellow at the Electronic Privacy Information Center, said that many tools already exist in order to fight this type of crime, and, unlike Clearview, they don’t involve an unsanctioned mass collection of the photos that billions of people post to platforms like Instagram and Facebook. “If police simply want to identify victims of child trafficking, there are robust databases and methods that already exist,” he said. “They don’t need Clearview AI to do this.” Since early 2020, regulators in Canada, France, Sweden, Australia, the UK, and Finland have opened investigations into their government agencies’ use of Clearview. Some privacy experts believe Clearview violated the EU’s data privacy laws, known as the GDPR. To be sure, the GDPR includes some exemptions for law enforcement. It explicitly notes that “covert investigations or video surveillance” can be carried out “for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection, or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, including the safeguarding against and the prevention of threats to public security…” But in June 2020, the European Data Protection Board, the independent body that oversees the application of the GDPR, issued guidance that “the use of a service such as Clearview AI by law enforcement authorities in the European Union would, as it stands, likely not be consistent with the EU data protection regime.” This January, the Hamburg Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information in Germany — a country where agencies had no known use of Clearview as of February 2020, according to data — went one step further; it deemed that Clearview itself was in violation of the GDPR and ordered the company to delete biometric information associated with an individual who had filed an earlier complaint. In his response to questions from BuzzFeed News, Ton-That said Clearview has “voluntarily processed” requests from people within the European Union to have their personal information deleted from the company’s databases. He also noted that Clearview does not have contracts with any EU customers “and is not currently available in the EU.” He declined to specify when Clearview stopped being available in the EU.\n\nCBS This Morning via YouTube / Via youtube.com Clearview AI CEO Hoan Ton-That\n\nChristoph Schmon, the international policy director for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, told BuzzFeed News that the GDPR adds a new level of complexity for European police officers who had used Clearview. Under the GDPR, police can’t use personal or biometric data unless doing so is “necessary to protect the vital interests” of a person. But if law enforcement agencies aren’t aware they have officers using Clearview, it's impossible to make such evaluations. “If authorities have basically not known that their staff tried Clearview — that I find quite astonishing and quite unbelievable, to be honest,” he said. “It’s the job of law enforcement authorities to know the circumstances that they can produce citizen data and an even higher responsibility to be held accountable for any misuse of citizen data.”\n\n\"If authorities have basically not known that their staff tried Clearview — that I find quite astonishing.\"\n\nMany experts and civil rights groups have argued that there should be a ban on governmental use of facial recognition. Regardless of whether a facial recognition software is accurate, groups like the Algorithmic Justice League argue that without regulation and proper oversight it can cause overpolicing or false arrests. “Our general stance is that facial recognition tech is problematic, so governments should never use it,” Schmon said. Not only is there a high chance that police officers will misuse facial recognition, he said, but the technology tends to misidentify people of color at higher rates than it does white people. Schmon also noted that facial recognition tools don’t provide facts. They provide a probability that a person matches an image. “Even if the probabilities were engineered correctly, it may still reflect biases,” he said. “They are not neutral.” Clearview did not answer questions about its claims of accuracy. In a March statement to BuzzFeed News, Ton-That said, “As a person of mixed race, ensuring that Clearview AI is non-biased is of great importance to me.” He added, “Based on independent testing and the fact that there have been no reported wrongful arrests related to the use of Clearview AI, we are meeting that standard.” Despite being investigated and, in some cases banned around the world, Clearview’s executives appear to have already begun laying the groundwork for further expansion. The company recently raised $30 million, according to the New York Times, and it has made a number of new hires. Last August, cofounders Ton-That and Richard Schwartz, along with other Clearview executives, appeared on registration papers for companies called Standard International Technologies in Panama and Singapore. In a deposition for an ongoing lawsuit in the US this year, Clearview executive Thomas Mulcaire shed some light on the purpose of those companies. While the subsidiary companies do not yet have any clients, he said, the Panama entity was set up to “potentially transact with law enforcement agencies in Latin America and the Caribbean that would want to use Clearview software.” Mulcaire also said the newly formed Singapore company could do business with Asian law enforcement agencies. In a statement, Ton-That stopped short of confirming those intentions but provided no other explanation for the move. “Clearview AI has set up two international entities that have not conducted any business,” he said. ● CONTRIBUTED REPORTING: Ken Bensinger, Salvador Hernandez, Brianna Sacks, Pranav Dixit, Logan McDonald, John Paczkowski, Mat Honan, Jeremy Singer-Vine, Ben King, Emily Ashton, Hannah Ryan","source":null},{"_id":{"$oid":"625c4e36ceb2b567b3df8511"},"feed_source":"BuzzFeed News","title":"She Smuggled Women In Kabul To Safety.

She had learned the news from a friend — the same friend who on Sunday had told her that the Taliban were going door-to-door across neighborhoods trying to find women like her, the same friend who now warned her that it was time to go into hiding. The women on the list were journalists, politicians, pilots, business entrepreneurs — what they had in common was that they had been speaking about the rights of Afghan women loudly and persistently, online and IRL, for years.\n\nAyoubi is one of thousands of women who have built thriving, prosperous lives for themselves in Afghanistan over the past two decades, but with the fall of Kabul, their success and outspokenness have come to haunt them. Though the United States had long insisted that the rights of Afghan women would be a cornerstone of any peace deal with the Taliban, that promise now lies in tatters. As the Taliban enforce their writ on the capital city, Ayoubi and other women’s rights advocates have been left to fend for themselves.\n\nEarlier that day, Aug. 18, Ayoubi, 28, had smuggled the young women who worked for her fashion brands to their homes from various points across the city by car. It was safer for the women to travel in packs, accompanied by their male work colleagues, who now functioned as de facto bodyguards.\n\nFor Ayoubi, one of Afghanistan’s first and youngest women to build her own furniture production company, the bad news was unrelenting; her network of friends and fellow activists constantly pinged one another with locations where the Taliban had set up checkpoints. Seventy-two hours after Kabul collapsed, she said, she received word that her home and offices had been raided four times by armed men who asked the staff and neighbors for her family’s whereabouts and belongings.\n\nIn the beginning, Ayoubi was reluctant to leave behind everything she had built — her flourishing business, her home, her family.

People have been seen clinging to a military cargo plane, scaling walls topped with barbed wire, and crowding the airport tarmac. Watching the news at her home in Paris has made Le feel despair, grief, and anger while also bringing up painful memories of her childhood in postwar Vietnam.\n\nBorn in 1983 in Dalat, a tourist destination about 190 miles northeast of Ho Chi Minh City (formerly Saigon), Le grew up in poverty, begging relatives for money and relying on neighbors for oil to cook the family’s food. After being labeled a traitor for fighting alongside the Americans during the war, her father struggled to find work. In addition to his imprisonment after Saigon fell, he was captured a second time after Le’s birth when he tried to escape Vietnam by boat. Now, as she follows the news out of Afghanistan, Le worries about the fates of those who may be left behind like her family was 46 years ago.\n\n“I think about my family, about what they’ve been through ... and I think that what’s going to happen in Afghanistan [is] going to be so much, even worse than what I can imagine,” Le told BuzzFeed News. “I mean, the worst thing is that they are killed, but I think being shunned from society, being abused by the people who come into power, I don’t know if that’s a lot better.”\n\nIn the days since the Taliban seized Kabul, President Joe Biden and his administration have defended their handling of the withdrawal of American troops as they move to end 20 years of war, dismissing comparisons to the fall of Saigon in 1975.

But until June, no one had ever threatened the titan of editorial cartooning. So when he saw an email from Twitter’s legal department in his inbox in June, he was surprised.\n\n“I thought it was a prank,” he said. But it wasn’t.\n\nThe email said the company had received a legal order from Indian law enforcement against him, claiming that his Twitter account, which in spring had been full of satirical cartoons featuring Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s disastrous handling of the country’s coronavirus pandemic, had violated Indian laws.\n\nTwitter explained that it hadn’t complied with the order and advised that Manjul could take legal counsel to challenge it in court, seek help from civil society organizations, delete his tweets, or “find some other resolution.”\n\n“We understand that receiving this type of notice can be an unsettling experience,” the company wrote.\n\nManjul told BuzzFeed News he found the email disturbing. “I got very upset and angry,” he said. “No one told me what laws I violated. Everybody has a political opinion in this country. I am not abusing the government.”\n\nWhen he tweeted a screenshot of the email to his more than 200,000 followers, he wrote “Hail the Modi government!” in Hindi, and almost immediately, the Indian internet exploded. The move to silence him was seen by many as yet another step by India’s increasingly authoritarian government to clamp down on dissent.\n\nFor months, the country’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, led by Modi, a nationalist autocrat accused of reshaping India’s secular ethos into a Hindu state, had been hard at work trying to quell an upswell of criticism on social media after a deadly second wave of the pandemic killed thousands and protests from millions of farmers against new agricultural laws rocked the nation. But it wasn’t until the last week of May that things came to a head.\n\nFrom May 26, India’s government armed itself with policies that empowered it to crack down on virtually all major digital platforms — social media companies like Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, and Instagram, messaging apps like WhatsApp, streaming services like Netflix and Amazon Prime, and news websites.\n\nAmong the new rules, which were first proposed in February, was one that requires social media platforms and streaming services to hire additional staff to address “grievances” filed by Indians offended by certain content and to employ full-time officers to liaise with law enforcement agencies around the clock. Others required news websites to submit monthly compliance reports and to agree to moderate or remove stories, podcasts, and videos flagged by a government committee. Another mandates that in certain circumstances messaging apps like WhatsApp must allow the government to track who texted whom, effectively breaking encryption.\n\nThe immediate consequences for not complying with these rules can be severe — companies can be slapped with heavy fines, local staffers can be jailed. And the broader consequences could be worse: losing protection from being held liable for content that people post, which could open companies up to all kinds of lawsuits.\n\nIf a streaming platform doesn’t respond or give an explanation that satisfies the complainant, they can appeal to the federal government, which can ultimately compel the platform to censor, edit, or take down the content in question.\n\nIt’s a sea change for Silicon Valley.","source":null},{"_id":{"$oid":"625c4e37ceb2b567b3df8514"},"feed_source":"BuzzFeed News","title":"These Photos Of Haiti Show The Pain And Turmoil From Back-To-Back Natural Disasters","link":"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/kirstenchilstrom/haiti-tropical-storm-photos","published":"Thu, 19 Aug 2021 14:21:54 -0400","author":"David Mack","summary":"Heavy rains from Tropical Storm Grace battered the island of Haiti on Tuesday, days after a deadly earthquake devastated the Caribbean nation.\nSaturday’s magnitude 7.2 tremor killed more than 1,000 people and left tens of thousands of others without homes.\nDays after the quake, bodies still lie in the streets as officials grapple with the chaos and poor weather.\nMany other people are too scared to return to their homes, fearing another tremor will bring them down.\nAs people seek what shelter they can, often in makeshift tents, humanitarian workers have been delivering food and tending to injuries.","published_parsed":[2021,8,19,18,21,54,3,231,0],"authors":[{"name":"Kirsten Chilstrom"},{"name":"David Mack"}],"tags":["turmoil","natural","food","tremor","pain","disasters","photos","save","killed","earthquake","shelter","need","children","backtoback","weather","haiti"],"comments":null,"content":"Heavy rains from Tropical Storm Grace battered the island of Haiti on Tuesday, days after a deadly earthquake devastated the Caribbean nation.

That's why I'm so passionate about that.”\n\nDearing said that while she isn’t very happy with her Olympic performance, she has been getting messages of support.\n\n“Literally everybody else is just like, well done for getting there in the first place, well done for standing up, and having these conversations being part of something that's bigger than yourself and advocating for change,'' she said.","source":null},{"_id":{"$oid":"625c4e3aceb2b567b3df851a"},"feed_source":"BuzzFeed News","title":"Yes, Delta Is Scary, But Europe’s Recent COVID Surges Show That It Can Be Controlled","link":"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/peteraldhous/delta-variant-wave-uk-europe","published":"Sun, 08 Aug 2021 22:00:03 -0400","author":"Peter Aldhous","summary":"In both countries, a steep rise in cases was followed by a similarly rapid decline, suggesting that the fast-spreading Delta variant typically burns itself out fairly quickly.\nFirst, if we simply let Delta take its course, the cost in lives and overburdened hospitals will be high.\n“You would overwhelm your healthcare system.”Second, if you look at the diversity of the Delta curves seen across Europe, it is far from clear that there is a typical fast-burning Delta wave.\nDig deeper into the reasons behind the different Delta waves seen across Europe, and a more hopeful message emerges: Scary as it is, the Delta variant seems to be controllable.\nVaccination is our best weapon, but the modest social distancing measures that have worked against other, less transmissible forms of the coronavirus can still help in a big way.","published_parsed":[2021,8,9,2,0,3,0,221,0],"authors":[{"name":"Peter Aldhous"}],"tags":["vaccination","vaccinated","controlled","big","covid","variant","delta","suggesting","way","recent","europes","seen","waves","surges","yes","europe","scary"],"comments":null,"content":"In the past couple of weeks, the Delta coronavirus variant has dashed the hopes of many Americans looking forward to celebrating a “hot vax summer” and the end of the pandemic.\n\nAs health experts warned in June, the highly contagious Delta variant has hit especially hard in states with low rates of vaccination, filling hospitals and morgues yet again in a return to some of the pandemic’s darkest days. And unlike with previous variants, new data suggests that some vaccinated people who get infected with Delta — while overwhelmingly protected against severe disease — can still spread the virus to others. This has led the CDC to advise that vaccinated people in areas with higher viral transmission should resume wearing masks in indoor public spaces.\n\nBig questions still remain about the extent to which “breakthrough” cases are spreading Delta. But there is now a growing sense of dread that Delta will be an unstoppable force.\n\nYet the message from experts who are watching Delta waves in Europe is more encouraging, suggesting that the usual rulebook still applies: Vaccination and strategies like masking indoors in public and avoiding crowds can keep case numbers down.\n\nMeanwhile, some observers have looked at what happened with Delta in the UK and India, where the variant was first discovered, and speculated that the US’s Delta misery may at least be short-lived, whatever we do to limit its spread. In both countries, a steep rise in cases was followed by a similarly rapid decline, suggesting that the fast-spreading Delta variant typically burns itself out fairly quickly.\n\nThere are two big problems with this view. First, if we simply let Delta take its course, the cost in lives and overburdened hospitals will be high.\n\n“On the way to that point, there would be a catastrophic number of hospitalizations,” Lauren Ancel Meyers, a computational epidemiologist at the University of Texas at Austin and director of the UT COVID-19 Modeling Consortium, told BuzzFeed News. “You would overwhelm your healthcare system.”\n\nSecond, if you look at the diversity of the Delta curves seen across Europe, it is far from clear that there is a typical fast-burning Delta wave. And in those countries that have seen a rapid rise and fall, changes in people’s behavior — rather than the inherent characteristics of the Delta variant — seem to be a big part of what has turned things around.\n\nDig deeper into the reasons behind the different Delta waves seen across Europe, and a more hopeful message emerges: Scary as it is, the Delta variant seems to be controllable. Vaccination is our best weapon, but the modest social distancing measures that have worked against other, less transmissible forms of the coronavirus can still help in a big way.","source":null},{"_id":{"$oid":"625c4e3aceb2b567b3df851b"},"feed_source":"BuzzFeed News","title":"“It Is Unequivocal”: Humans Are Driving Worsening Climate Disasters, Hundreds Of Scientists Said In A New Report","link":"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/zahrahirji/ipcc-climate-change-report-2021","published":"Wed, 11 Aug 2021 14:12:40 -0400","author":"Zahra Hirji","summary":"A new United Nations climate report released on Monday morning lays out in stark terms how climate change is already wreaking havoc on the world, warning that any additional warming will only fuel more extreme disasters.\n“It is unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, ocean and land,” according to a summary distilling the report’s findings for policymakers.\nThe latest report stands apart from previous versions for explicitly pointing to the cause of the climate crisis: human-induced climate pollution.\nHundreds of scientists worldwide contributed to the report and its key findings, which are spelled out in the policymaker summary.\nThe new report’s findings will likely add to the pressure facing world leaders who will be meeting in Glasgow in November as part of their ongoing participation in the Paris climate agreement.","published_parsed":[2021,8,11,18,12,40,2,223,0],"authors":[{"name":"Zahra Hirji"}],"tags":["driving","climate","summary","change","scientists","humans","unequivocal","disasters","findings","report","warming","released","impacts","reports","world","worsening","hundreds"],"comments":null,"content":"A new United Nations climate report released on Monday morning lays out in stark terms how climate change is already wreaking havoc on the world, warning that any additional warming will only fuel more extreme disasters.\n\n“It is unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, ocean and land,” according to a summary distilling the report’s findings for policymakers. “Human-induced climate change is already affecting many weather and climate extremes in every region across the globe.”\n\n\n\nThe highly anticipated report is part of the sixth climate assessment released by the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which provides the most comprehensive scientific overview of the impacts of the climate crisis so far and an analysis of how bad it could still get.\n\nThe latest report stands apart from previous versions for explicitly pointing to the cause of the climate crisis: human-induced climate pollution.

But the US and other governments have called it a genocide. Last July the US placed sanctions on the organization, known as the XPCC or bingtuan in Chinese, as well as two officials associated with it, citing “their connection to serious human rights abuses against ethnic minorities in Xinjiang.”\n\nThe move effectively made it illegal for anyone in the US to do business with XPCC and made it more difficult for the organization to work with other countries, too. But new research from a Washington, DC–based nonprofit shows that the XPCC’s many subsidiaries continue to export goods all over the world. The report found that some of the consumer items made with those products, such as tomato sauce or textiles, are sold in the United States as well as to other countries like Australia, Canada, and Germany.\n\nC4ADS, a group that reports on global conflict and security, identified 2,923 subsidiaries of the XPCC and used business filings, trade records, and postings on a Chinese cotton industry trading site to investigate their business activities.\n\nThe group found that a Russian company called Grand Star makes tomato products and sauces under the brand name Kubanochka. Two XPCC subsidiaries, Xinjiang Guannong Tomato Products and Xinjiang Wanda Co., have sent Grand Star more than 150 shipments of tomato paste.\n\n\n\nThe report uncovered companies that buy goods from Xinjiang and send products elsewhere, but trade data does not make clear whether specific banned items arrived in the US. It’s therefore difficult to know whether the same tomatoes imported from Xinjiang were then sent on to the US, but it’s clear that Kubanochka’s branded tomato products are sold in the United States, including in international food stores. Grand Star did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nC4ADS also found that at least three XPCC subsidiary companies sell XPCC cotton despite being part of the Better Cotton Initiative, a global industry accreditation program that says it promotes ethical sourcing of cotton products. The Better Cotton Initiative declined to comment about whether these companies’ activities conflict with its principles.\n\n\n\nOne of the three subsidiaries, Xiamen ITG, is a supply chain management company worth nearly 14 billion yuan. According to government trade data compiled by Panjiva, Xiamen ITG and its own subsidiaries have supplied small and large North American retailers, including Walmart Canada and an Ohio-based company called MMI Textiles, a military supply company that has also provided protective equipment to hospitals. Xiamen ITG sent two shipments of polyester and cotton fabric to MMI in 2019, trade data shows, before the US began blocking Xinjiang cotton. Asked about the shipments, MMI Textiles’ chief operating officer, Nick Rivera, said it stopped working with the firm in January 2019 and that MMI was “troubled to learn of the details which you described in your inquiry.”\n\nFounded in 1954 — just five years after the ruling Communist Party took power in China — the XPCC originally focused on resettling Han Chinese migrants in the Xinjiang region, which is the historical home of Uyghurs and other mostly Muslim minority groups. About 86% of current XPCC members are Han Chinese, according to research published by Yajun Bao at the University of Oxford. The XPCC is so powerful that Bao and other scholars have described it as having a parallel role to the Xinjiang regional government, with interests ranging from cotton farming to television and radio. The XPCC has thousands of subsidiaries and makes up to 21% of the region’s production, including through manufacturing.\n\n“The XPCC is a primary perpetrator of mass detentions and forced labor in Xinjiang, and it has a massive economic footprint,” said Irina Bukharin, the lead researcher for the C4ADS report. “It’s also sanctioned, so understanding how it’s still connected to the global economy is important for understanding how sanctions and other measures targeting forced labor in the region are falling short.”\n\nUS Customs and Border Protection in January said it would detain all tomato and cotton products imported from Xinjiang. C4ADS found, however, that both kinds of products could be making it to the United States including by traveling through third countries. The XPCC is the largest producer of cotton in China and is also a major player in the tomato industry.\n\nDetaining shipments from the region is not always a clear-cut process, in part because XPCC companies often sell their products through middle companies in other parts of China or other countries. Ana Hinojosa, a Customs and Border Protection official, told BuzzFeed News that the difficulty of getting information about companies in Xinjiang presented a challenge for US regulators.\n\n“The XPCC is a behemoth of an organization. It has so many subsidiaries, and they shift and change frequently,” said Hinojosa, who is CBP’s executive director for trade remedy law enforcement. “It is a difficult task to keep track of them.”\n\n“I think that there are probably some goods that are coming to the US that we’re not aware yet that they’re connected to the XPCC,” she added.\n\nThe XPCC did not respond to requests for comment.","source":null},{"_id":{"$oid":"625c4e3bceb2b567b3df851d"},"feed_source":"BuzzFeed News","title":"Looking Back At Meghan Markle's Last 15 Years For Her 40th Birthday","link":"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/piapeterson/meghan-markle-40th-birthday-photos","published":"Wed, 04 Aug 2021 20:11:49 -0400","author":"Pia Peterson","summary":"FINCEN FILESTHE INVESTIGATION THAT CHANGED THE BANKING INDUSTRYA BuzzFeed News investigation, in partnership with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, based on thousands of documents the government didn't want you to see.","published_parsed":[2021,8,5,0,11,49,3,217,0],"authors":[{"name":"Pia Peterson"}],"tags":["15","journalists","partnership","40th","fincen","filesthe","documents","thousands","investigative","markles","international","industrya","investigation","meghan","looking","birthday"],"comments":null,"content":"FINCEN FILES\n\nTHE INVESTIGATION THAT CHANGED THE BANKING INDUSTRY\n\nA BuzzFeed News investigation, in partnership with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, based on thousands of documents the government didn't want you to see.","source":null},{"_id":{"$oid":"625c4e3bceb2b567b3df851e"},"feed_source":"BuzzFeed News","title":"Simone Biles Won A Bronze Medal In Her Olympic Return","link":"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ikrd/simone-biles-bronze-tokyo","published":"Tue, 03 Aug 2021 16:25:34 -0400","author":"Ikran Dahir","summary":"She scored 14.000, earning Biles her seventh Olympic medal.\nThis ties her with Shannon Miller for the most Olympic medals in US gymnastics history.\n\"I was proud of myself just to go out there after what I've been through,\" Biles said afterward.\nBiles also won bronze at the balance beam during the Rio Olympics in 2016 — alongside four gold medals during those Games.\nChina's Guan Chenchen and Tang Xijing won gold and silver, respectively.","published_parsed":[2021,8,3,20,25,34,1,215,0],"authors":[{"name":"Ikran Dahir"}],"tags":["medals","bronze","ive","won","olympic","gold","medal","gymnastics","simone","return","beam","biles","olympics"],"comments":null,"content":"As the rest of the Olympics progressed, it was unclear whether Biles would be able to compete again, but on Monday USA Gymnastics announced she would return to the Olympic stage on the balance beam on Tuesday — the final women's gymnastics event of the Games.\n\nBiles dismounted safely as her teammates cheered her on.

Because of that, the “utility of the token increases dramatically” and the “price of the token increases.”\n\nKey to all of this technology is the Orb itself, and the contract that Orb operators sign underlines the company’s focus on stress-testing it. \"Your role is to help us evaluate the Orbs and how people interact with them,” the contract says. “You should think of yourself as a product tester.”\n\nBlania told BuzzFeed News that the company was primarily using its field tests to see how the Orbs performed in different environments — from Kenya’s heat to Norway’s freezing cold. “In Kenya where there was like, 40-degree heat, and just the reflection on the Orb is something we have never seen here in Germany in the office,” Blania said.\n\nAdam Schwartz, a senior staff attorney for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, said the ambiguity about Worldcoin’s goals is troublesome. “The question is, is this a digital currency company, or is this a data broker?” he said. “Either way, the practice at hand, which is paying people for their biometrics, is very problematic to privacy and to equity.”\n\n“Worldcoin is not a data company and our business model does not involve exploiting or selling personal user data. Worldcoin is only interested in a user’s uniqueness — i.e., that they have not signed up for Worldcoin before — not their identity,” Worldcoin said in a statement.\n\nThe company’s efforts to build its database could also run afoul of data privacy and processing laws in Kenya, where the company has extensive operations. Kenya recently passed a data protection law that forbids companies from transferring biometric data abroad without approval from the newly constituted Office of the Data Protection Commissioner. Worldcoin currently processes user data in the US, UK, Germany, Japan, and India, according to its data consent form.\n\nImmaculate Kassait, Kenya’s data commissioner, told BuzzFeed News that her office “was not aware” that Worldcoin was collecting the biometric data of Kenyans and transferring it abroad.\n\nThe company has until July 14 to register itself with the commission and submit a detailed Data Protection Impact Assessment under Kenya’s newly implemented data privacy laws, Kassait said over email. Worldcoin told BuzzFeed News that the company would soon engage with Kenya’s Data Commission and had already conducted a “rigorous” privacy impact assessment.\n\nBryan Ford, who heads the Decentralized/Distributed Systems (DEDIS) lab at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology and wrote one of the pioneering papers on proof of personhood in 2008, said solving the authentication problem in a way that preserves user privacy would be a significant advance. Ford, however, isn’t convinced by Worldcoin’s solution. The company’s decision to build and store a giant, centralized database of irises and iris-hashes, he said, is a massive invasion of user privacy.\n\n“We dispute the characterization that collecting images of Worldcoin users is an invasion of privacy: If collecting images of people with their consent was an invasion of privacy, CLEAR” — the biometrics identification company — “the UN and Aadhaar would all be examples of invasions of privacy too,” Worldcoin said in a statement to BuzzFeed News.\n\nPrivacy advocates and security experts in India have long characterized Aadhaar, India’s massive biometric identification system, as a privacy nightmare. Experts also dispute whether Worldcoin has done enough to ensure that it has obtained informed consent from people, given that the company’s extensive terms and conditions, privacy policy, and data consent forms are in English.\n\n“Informed consent means that you are in a position to fully understand what is going on,” said Elias Okwara, Africa policy manager for the advocacy group Access Now, noting that a majority of Kenya’s population speaks Kiswahili. “So right off the bat, it becomes difficult to be able to explain to an individual what the data processing means.”\n\nWorldcoin said it would soon roll out its privacy form in six languages and suggested that the Orb operators were live-translating and explaining the company’s voluminous policies to people who do not speak English. “In all these local countries, we have Orb operators, and their whole purpose and role is to explain to people what they consent to in their local languages,” the company said.\n\nAny large biometric database is also susceptible to hacking, Ford said, explaining that the database could be compromised if someone hacks into the thousands of Orbs that the company plans on distributing. “Basically no hardware is reliably unhackable,” Ford said.\n\nBlania conceded that “there has never been an uncracked hardware device” but said that Worldcoin was building fraud-detection mechanisms to identify compromised Orbs.","source":null,"insert_date":{"$date":"2022-04-25T13:42:34.719Z"}},{"_id":{"$oid":"626abeee2345430f275e3eb0"},"feed_source":"BuzzFeed News","title":"A Former Marine Was Freed From “Wrongful Detention” In Russia, But Concerns Remain For Brittney Griner And Others","link":"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/davidmack/brittney-griner-trevor-reed-paul-whelan-russia","published":{"$date":"2022-04-28T16:25:03Z"},"author":"David Mack","summary":"US Marine veteran Trevor Reed is on his way home after being released from Russia, where officials said he was wrongfully detained since 2019.\n“Today, our prayers have been answered and Trevor is safely on his way back to the United States,” his family said in a statement.\nThe surprise prisoner exchange was the result of long and difficult negotiations between the US and Russia, according to both countries.\nReed’s family said Biden’s decision to go ahead with the prisoner swap may have saved the former Marine’s life.\nThe State Department has previously declined to identify exactly how many Americans have been detained in Russia, but there are at least two high-profile prisoners who remain behind bars there: Paul Whelan and WNBA star Brittney Griner.","published_parsed":[2022,4,28,16,25,3,3,118,0],"authors":[{"name":"David Mack"}],"tags":["released","missed","brittney","griner","family","remains","russia","prisoner","biden","way","detained","reed","trevor","release","department"],"comments":null,"content":"US Marine veteran Trevor Reed is on his way home after being released from Russia, where officials said he was wrongfully detained since 2019.\n\n\n\n“Today, our prayers have been answered and Trevor is safely on his way back to the United States,” his family said in a statement.\n\nReed’s release came as part of a prisoner swap with Russia, with the US sending back Konstantin Yaroshenko, a Russian pilot sentenced in 2011 to a 20-year prison term for importing more than $100 million of cocaine.\n\nThe surprise prisoner exchange was the result of long and difficult negotiations between the US and Russia, according to both countries. The fraught diplomacy was made all the more extraordinary because of the utter collapse of relations between Washington and Moscow over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nPresident Joe Biden, who met with the Reed family last month, said in a statement on Wednesday that the negotiations to release him “required difficult decisions that I do not take lightly.”\n\n“I heard in the voices of Trevor’s parents how much they’ve worried about his health and missed his presence,” Biden said. “And I was delighted to be able to share with them the good news about Trevor’s freedom.”\n\nReed, 30, was imprisoned for allegedly assaulting a police officer while he was drunk, but his family and US diplomats said he was innocent, describing the evidence against him at trial as “preposterous” and “absurd.” Instead, they said he was being held as a bargaining chip.\n\nIn recent weeks, Reed’s health had deteriorated and he had been hospitalized with signs of tuberculosis and a possible broken rib, according to the State Department, making his release all the more urgent.\n\nReed’s family said Biden’s decision to go ahead with the prisoner swap may have saved the former Marine’s life. They had previously expressed fears that Reed might suffer the same fate as Otto Warmbier, the American student held for 17 months in North Korea who went into a coma after his 2017 release and died.\n\nThe State Department has previously declined to identify exactly how many Americans have been detained in Russia, but there are at least two high-profile prisoners who remain behind bars there: Paul Whelan and WNBA star Brittney Griner.\n\nWhelan, another former Marine, has been detained the longest, having been first arrested at the end of 2018, and accused of being an American spy.

But as Musk scrambles to pull together funding for the $44 billion deal, the billionaire is also planning to accept financing for the deal from two countries that have historically restricted freedom of speech: Saudi Arabia and Qatar.\n\nOn Thursday, an SEC filing revealed new financiers for Musk’s takeover plan, which include Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal and Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund. Both countries impose harsh censorship to quash dissent: A Qatari law states that spreading “false or malicious news” can land you in prison for five years, while in Saudi Arabia, critics of the government have faced arrest and even murder. Saudi Arabia ranks number 166 out of 180 on the World Press Freedom Index, while Qatar ranks number 119, according to Reporters Without Borders.\n\nTwitter didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on the financing.\n\nPrince Alwaleed wrote on Twitter that the Kingdom Holding Company, an investment firm he controls, would roll over its current $1.9 billion investment in Twitter to join Musk on “this exciting journey.” The move comes after Alwaleed spurned Musk’s plan in a tweet last month, saying the Tesla CEO’s offer didn’t come close to the “intrinsic value” of the company. KHC has been a Twitter stakeholder since 2011.\n\nMusk responded by asking about the size of the Kingdom's stake in Twitter, as well as the country’s views on “journalistic freedom of speech.” Saudi Arabia has been frequently criticized for censorship and human rights abuses, including the 2018 murder of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi. The Saudi government has denied any involvement by its leaders.\n\nThe prince didn’t publicly answer Musk’s questions, but in his tweet Thursday called Musk a “‘new’ friend” and “excellent leader.”\n\nThe sovereign wealth fund of Qatar will also contribute $375 million to Musk’s takeover deal. In 2020, the country issued a law that threatens to imprison “anyone who broadcasts, publishes, or republishes false or biased rumors, statements, or news, or inflammatory propaganda, domestically or abroad, with the intent to harm national interests, stir up public opinion, or infringe on the social system or the public system of the state.”\n\nLast year, the government arrested seven people for using social media “to spread false news” during its elections. The country also has a history of suppressing free speech. In 2012, a Qatari poet was sentenced to 15 years in jail after reciting a poem critical of the government.\n\nWhen the 2020 law was issued, Amnesty International called it “another bitter blow to freedom of expression in the country” and said it “is a blatant breach of international human rights law.” Musk has said he wants to ensure free speech on Twitter as long as it doesn't violate local law, so Qatar's financial involvement puts him in a potentially precarious position.\n\nThe financing and the conflicts of interest it creates underscore the difficulty Musk will face as he tries to implement his vision for Twitter. Musk said last month that he sees the platform as a digital town square. “My strong intuitive sense is that having a public platform that is maximally trusted and broadly inclusive is extremely important to the future of civilization,” he said.\n\nOther backers announced Thursday include the billionaire Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison, who is investing $1 billion, and the cryptocurrency exchange Binance, which is putting in $500 million.","source":null,"insert_date":{"$date":"2022-05-09T15:46:11.582Z"}},{"_id":{"$oid":"62793743c53c989f00c99da9"},"feed_source":"BuzzFeed News","title":"Jill Biden Made A Surprise Visit To Ukraine To Meet With Their First Lady","link":"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/davidmack/jill-biden-ukraine-first-lady","published":{"$date":"2022-05-09T03:25:07Z"},"author":"David Mack","summary":"First lady Jill Biden made a surprise visit into Ukraine on Sunday and met with Olena Zelenska, the wife of President Volodymyr Zelensky.\nZelenska has been in hiding since Russia's invasion began in late February.\n“I wanted to come on Mother’s Day,\" Biden told reporters traveling with her after they crossed into the city of Uzhhorod in western Ukraine from neighboring Slovakia.\n\"I thought it was important to show the Ukrainian people that this war has to stop and this war has been brutal, and that the people of the United States stand with the people of Ukraine.”The two women embraced outside a local school that is now being used as temporary housing for people who have fled fighting to the east.\n\"I would like to thank you for a very courageous act,\" Zelenska told Biden after being gifted with a bouquet of flowers, \"because we understand what it takes for the US first lady to come here during a war when the military actions are taking place every day, where the air sirens are happening every day, even today.”","published_parsed":[2022,5,9,3,25,7,0,129,0],"authors":[{"name":"David Mack"}],"tags":["come","women","jill","zelenska","lady","day","biden","told","visit","surprise","zelensky","ukraine","meet","war"],"comments":null,"content":"First lady Jill Biden made a surprise visit into Ukraine on Sunday and met with Olena Zelenska, the wife of President Volodymyr Zelensky.

Forty-one of those countries are in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nFor these countries, a team led by Jonathan Wakefield, a statistician at the University of Washington in Seattle, used the data from countries with complete death registries to build another statistical model able to predict total COVID deaths in any month from other measures, including temperature, the percentage of COVID tests returning positive, a rating of the stringency of social distancing and other measures to limit infection, and rates of diabetes and cardiovascular disease — conditions that put people at high risk of dying from COVID.\n\nThe Indian health ministry objected strongly to this model in its response to the New York Times article. But the WHO team didn’t actually use it to estimate Indian COVID deaths. India falls into an intermediate group of countries that have reasonably good data on total deaths in some regions but not in others. So Wakefield’s team used data from 17 Indian states with adequate death registries, applied the standard excess deaths approach used for countries with complete death registries, and then extrapolated from these states to the entire country.\n\n“We only base the predictions of how many people died in India in those two years on Indian data,” Wakefield told BuzzFeed News.\n\nImportantly, the WHO’s estimates for Indian COVID deaths also align well with other studies, including one published in the journal Science in January by a team led by Prabhat Jha, director of the Centre for Global Health Research at the University of Toronto in Canada. Jha’s team estimated COVID deaths from Indian government data and from a national survey of 137,000 people, conducted by a polling company that asked people whether a family member had died from COVID. “India has pretty high cellphone coverage, and they did random digit dialing,” Jha told BuzzFeed News.\n\nJha’s team estimated that more than 3.2 million people in India had died from COVID by July 2021, the majority of them during the devastating surge in COVID caused by the Delta coronavirus variant between April and June 2021. That came after the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi had relaxed COVID controls following an earlier, less severe wave. “The Indian government declared victory and said, ‘Oh India's beat this virus,’ and complacency set in,” Jha said.\n\nThis explains the political sensitivity in India about accepting the results from studies that indicate a much higher death toll than the official count. Responding to a question from leaders of the opposition Congress party about Jha’s study in February, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare described it as “speculative” and claimed it “lacks any peer reviewed scientific data” — even though it was published in one of the world’s leading peer-reviewed scientific journals.\n\n“It’s politics,” Jha said of the Indian government’s rejection of his study.\n\nAccording to the WHO, Egypt has proportionately the largest undercount of pandemic deaths, with excess mortality running at 11.6 times the toll attributed to COVID. India, with 9.9 times more excess deaths than its official COVID death count, is in second place. Russia, meanwhile, has reported 3.5 times fewer deaths from COVID than indicated by its excess mortality.\n\nAriel Karlinsky of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, another member of the WHO technical advisory group, hopes the agency’s “stamp of approval” for excess mortality calculations will encourage nations to come up with more realistic numbers. “Putin doesn’t know who I am, but they do know who the WHO is,” he told BuzzFeed News.\n\nBut rather than moving to correct their COVID death numbers, some governments are apparently now withholding the all-cause mortality data used to calculate excess deaths. Belarus, which seems to be undercounting its COVID deaths by a factor of about 12, has stopped reporting its all-cause mortality data to the UN, Karlinsky said. “The sections on mortality just disappeared.”\n\nRight now, the main concern is China, which is experiencing a significant wave of the Omicron coronavirus variant but is reporting suspiciously few deaths. If the wave now hitting Shanghai and other cities matches the pattern seen in Hong Kong since February, Jha fears that a million Chinese people may die.\n\nSome countries have responded to excess mortality studies with greater accountability and transparency. After earlier excess deaths analyses suggested that Peru was underreporting its COVID deaths by a factor of 2.7, the South American nation went through its medical and death records in detail and revised its death toll in May 2021 to a figure closely matching the excess deaths analysis. It is now reporting the highest official per-capita death rate from COVID of any nation. “Peru did what I would have liked every country to do,” Karlinsky said.\n\nThe WHO’s new estimates of total excess pandemic deaths will include people who died from other causes because health systems were overwhelmed, as well as people killed by the coronavirus.\n\nKarlinsky, who is an economist, said he started analyzing excess deaths because he wondered whether “the cure was worse than the disease” — in particular, he feared that lockdowns could cause more deaths than the coronavirus, in part through increases in suicides. But the data told a very different story.\n\nIn countries like New Zealand that had strict lockdowns but low levels of COVID, there is no excess deaths signal. There is also no evidence of a global epidemic of suicide during the pandemic — in the US, suicides actually decreased. Only in a few countries like Nicaragua, where people seem to have avoided going to the hospital because they were worried about getting infected, are there signs that deaths from other causes such as heart disease have increased, according to Karlinsky.\n\n“Excess mortality is about equal to COVID mortality,” he added.","source":null,"insert_date":{"$date":"2022-05-09T15:46:11.593Z"}},{"_id":{"$oid":"6298a695b2f9a74864e8cf44"},"feed_source":"BuzzFeed News","title":"Prince George, Princess Charlotte, And Prince Louis Made Their Trooping The Colour Carriage Debut","link":"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ellievhall/george-charlotte-louis-prince-princess-trooping-colour","published":{"$date":"2022-06-02T15:49:00Z"},"author":"Ellie Hall","summary":"For the first time, Prince George, Princess Charlotte, and Prince Louis rode in a carriage together for the annual Trooping the Colour parade, as the Queen's Platinum Jubilee celebrations kicked off in London on Thursday.\nThe children, dressed in blue, rode with their mother, Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge (aka Kate Middleton) and step-grandmother, Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall.\nTheir father, Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge, participated in the military parade on horseback.","published_parsed":[2022,6,2,15,49,0,3,153,0],"authors":[{"name":"Ellie Hall"}],"tags":["george","debut","queens","charlotte","louis","thursdaythe","colour","prince","trooping","william","princess","carriage","duchess","stepgrandmother","parade","rode","cambridge"],"comments":null,"content":"For the first time, Prince George, Princess Charlotte, and Prince Louis rode in a carriage together for the annual Trooping the Colour parade, as the Queen's Platinum Jubilee celebrations kicked off in London on Thursday.\n\nThe children, dressed in blue, rode with their mother, Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge (aka Kate Middleton) and step-grandmother, Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall.
