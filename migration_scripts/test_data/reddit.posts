probably win a defensive war against russia or at least deny them any sort of victory that would make it worth it especially now however the brutality of russia has reminded finland that even victory comes at great cost and nato membership would ensure that it wouldnt be a difficult long and brutal defensive war costing tens of thousands civilian lives but an immediate overwhelming victory \n\nhowever finland joining nato also has other aspects\n\n it is a punishment and a clear signal to russia that its foreign policy is a complete failure russias position in europe has irrevocably became worse and even if by some miracle for russia everything else went back sanctions were lifted and relations normalized finland would still be in nato\n this is a good time for finland to join as russia is stuck in ukraine and the finnish border hasnt been this empty of russian troops in decades russia doesnt have as many resources to spend on harassing finland during the joining process whatever plans russia may have had beforehand for the event that finland joined nato probably didnt account for russia being in a possibly losing war in ukraine \n if russia nevertheless tries to harass finland then all those resources are away from fighting ukraine which helps ukraine\n  russia may feel paranoid and feel the need to commit more troops to guarding the border and every troop stationed there is away from ukraine which also helps ukraine","created":"2022-05-15

im not a psychiatrist but i am an internal medicine doctor and ive done some consults for psychiatrists on drug side effects and ineffectiveness\n\ni think this is an interesting article and an interesting approach to counselling patients and helping them discuss the struggles they face with auditory and visual hallucinations im not very well informed about the therapy and counselling offered to schizophrenic or schizoaffective patients but this article is basically advocating for open nonjudgemental group therapy which has had success in a number of other fields in psychiatry i do wonder if this article is overstating the novelty of the approach when i frame it that way\n\nthere are a few parts of the article i take issue with for starters i think it overemphasizes clinician concerns with violence clinicians are well aware that patients with psychiatric disorders are much more likely to be victims of violence than perpetrators of violence concern with violent mental health patients is much more of a media trope than a clinical one not to say there isnt violence since i have seen patients try to fight staff on the mental health ward when ive had to do consults there\n\nthe other thing this article overemphasizes is the positive symptoms of auditoryvisual hallucinations there are lots of other problematic symptoms that this article ignores with delusions a fixed nonreal belief probably being the most pressing you might learn to ignore a voice telling you not to eat but if you have a delusion that all food is poison and you stop eating then that is going to severely impair your ability to selfcare antipsychotics are generally relatively effective in reducing the frequency and severity of positive symptoms but have much more difficulty improving negative symptoms like social withdrawal inactivity and catatonia i think it is interesting the article does not really talk about other positive symptoms and seems to ignore negative symptoms all together as a nonpsychiatrist clinician the biggest problem i run into with psych patients of all kinds is that their mental health impairs their selfcare if all you heard were voices and they didnt affect your life then maybe thats something a new paradigm can accommodate but a lot of patients with schizophrenia struggle to hold a job and maintain selfcare and thats really what psychiatrists are trying to address with medication not because they insist everyone live in the same reality because they hate fun\n\nsome of the language talking about positive experiences with hallucinations is interesting too many patients with bipolar really enjoy the highs they get with it and can be reluctant to lose that of course those highs can also be accompanied by harmful behaviours like infidelity excessive drug consumption excessive gambling etc hallucinations maybe fit a similar paradigm im sure some people occasionally get some positive experience form it but the negative consequences can be potentially severe\n\nthe other thing ill say is that i think the article really does not represent the field of psychiatric research fairly it is correct that psychiatry continues to struggle due to a strong lack of biological understanding of how these disease work and that has a knock on effect with treatments but it doesnt at all talk about recent fmri studies and the field of neuropsychiatry which is beginning to pick up steam and is starting to shed more light on how these things work \n\nthe other thing ill point out is that we are not investing money into psychiatric research nearly as much as we should if we are serious about it just about all forms of cancer had terrible prognoses back in the  and  and it was decades of work and billions of dollars that have improved things to the degree they have today we have not made similar investments in psychiatry for example i recently did a medicine consult on a patient who was having difficulty getting steady dosing on clozapine clozapine is probably the most effective antipsychotic we have but its use has been limited by its sideeffect profile including usual things like weight gain and elevated cholesterol but also has the rare but serious sideeffect of severely low white blood cell counts it turns out that weve discovered at least  years ago that the serum ratio of clozapine and its norclozapine metabolite helps determine things if your ratio is too low its less likely to be effective if its too high its more likely youll have metabolic sideeffects but theres a sweet spot at about  cloznorcloz weve known this for more than a decade but when i did my consult a few months back no one has invested in trying to understand why this ratio has this effect or what we can do to try and adjust that ratio\n\nso thats my two cents interesting article and approach for therapy but maybe less novel than the article presents article omits some important aspects including delusions negative symptoms and the effects of all these symptoms on selfcare article also trashes psych research without really appreciating where the field is going and the lack of investment in treating psychiatric illness","created":"2022-05-19

in the times about mental health in particular a group called hearing voices network and a home called afiya the piece explores the history of treating psychosis and similar mental diseases and how there is now a growing movement to stop medicating psychotic individuals questioning its efficacy in treating the illness\n\nhowever the subjects in the piece i think would disagree that psychosis is an illness at all while i dont completely distrust the idea that maybe theres a better way to treat psychotic individuals than just medicating them into a stupor im hesitant when reading this and how exactly these people and groups are going about it  a couple of quotes that to me seems awfully dangerous and makes me think its only a matter of time until something truly tragic or dangerous happens in these support homes that have no clinical support\n\nmazelcarlton takes care not to diminish the suffering of people like herself and speaks of expanding “the options for healing” yet she sees her wish as analogous to not just the mainstreaming of autism but the nascent acceptance of new forms of gender identity “our society needs to expand its view of what it means to be human” she says “to expand what is affirmed and honored”\n\nthe people who stay at afiya are in dire need many are not only in mental disarray but also homeless many are suicidal there are no clinicians on staff no security personnel only people who know such desperation firsthand in the living room a homemade banner declares “holding multiple truths knowing that everyone has their own accurate view of the way things are”\n\nguests he explained are free to come and go at any hour then he shared “i feel like i want to die every day it’s one of the first things i think about when i wake up that is normal for me many people act like it isn’t normal here we have people express that they want to harm someone these are all normal thoughts but people train themselves to believe that they’re not giving space to express these things to have these conversations that’s the healing thing that’s the magic here when we don’t allow that space things get bigger”\n\nfor mazelcarlton one of the groups’ most essential tenets is that there must be no disabusing anyone of a personal reality unlike on a psych ward or in many a psychiatrist’s office unusual beliefs are not monitored corrected constrained mazelcarlton’s

im not a psychiatrist but i am an internal medicine doctor and ive done some consults for psychiatrists on drug side effects and ineffectiveness\n\ni think this is an interesting article and an interesting approach to counselling patients and helping them discuss the struggles they face with auditory and visual hallucinations im not very well informed about the therapy and counselling offered to schizophrenic or schizoaffective patients but this article is basically advocating for open nonjudgemental group therapy which has had success in a number of other fields in psychiatry i do wonder if this article is overstating the novelty of the approach when i frame it that way\n\nthere are a few parts of the article i take issue with for starters i think it overemphasizes clinician concerns with violence clinicians are well aware that patients with psychiatric disorders are much more likely to be victims of violence than perpetrators of violence concern with violent mental health patients is much more of a media trope than a clinical one not to say there isnt violence since i have seen patients try to fight staff on the mental health ward when ive had to do consults there\n\nthe other thing this article overemphasizes is the positive symptoms of auditoryvisual hallucinations there are lots of other problematic symptoms that this article ignores with delusions a fixed nonreal belief probably being the most pressing you might learn to ignore a voice telling you not to eat but if you have a delusion that all food is poison and you stop eating then that is going to severely impair your ability to selfcare antipsychotics are generally relatively effective in reducing the frequency and severity of positive symptoms but have much more difficulty improving negative symptoms like social withdrawal inactivity and catatonia i think it is interesting the article does not really talk about other positive symptoms and seems to ignore negative symptoms all together as a nonpsychiatrist clinician the biggest problem i run into with psych patients of all kinds is that their mental health impairs their selfcare if all you heard were voices and they didnt affect your life then maybe thats something a new paradigm can accommodate but a lot of patients with schizophrenia struggle to hold a job and maintain selfcare and thats really what psychiatrists are trying to address with medication not because they insist everyone live in the same reality because they hate fun\n\nsome of the language talking about positive experiences with hallucinations is interesting too many patients with bipolar really enjoy the highs they get with it and can be reluctant to lose that of course those highs can also be accompanied by harmful behaviours like infidelity excessive drug consumption excessive gambling etc hallucinations maybe fit a similar paradigm im sure some people occasionally get some positive experience form it but the negative consequences can be potentially severe\n\nthe other thing ill say is that i think the article really does not represent the field of psychiatric research fairly it is correct that psychiatry continues to struggle due to a strong lack of biological understanding of how these disease work and that has a knock on effect with treatments but it doesnt at all talk about recent fmri studies and the field of neuropsychiatry which is beginning to pick up steam and is starting to shed more light on how these things work \n\nthe other thing ill point out is that we are not investing money into psychiatric research nearly as much as we should if we are serious about it just about all forms of cancer had terrible prognoses back in the  and  and it was decades of work and billions of dollars that have improved things to the degree they have today we have not made similar investments in psychiatry for example i recently did a medicine consult on a patient who was having difficulty getting steady dosing on clozapine clozapine is probably the most effective antipsychotic we have but its use has been limited by its sideeffect profile including usual things like weight gain and elevated cholesterol but also has the rare but serious sideeffect of severely low white blood cell counts it turns out that weve discovered at least  years ago that the serum ratio of clozapine and its norclozapine metabolite helps determine things if your ratio is too low its less likely to be effective if its too high its more likely youll have metabolic sideeffects but theres a sweet spot at about  cloznorcloz weve known this for more than a decade but when i did my consult a few months back no one has invested in trying to understand why this ratio has this effect or what we can do to try and adjust that ratio\n\nso thats my two cents interesting article and approach for therapy but maybe less novel than the article presents article omits some important aspects including delusions negative symptoms and the effects of all these symptoms on selfcare article also trashes psych research without really appreciating where the field is going and the lack of investment in treating psychiatric illness","created":"2022-05-19

in the times about mental health in particular a group called hearing voices network and a home called afiya the piece explores the history of treating psychosis and similar mental diseases and how there is now a growing movement to stop medicating psychotic individuals questioning its efficacy in treating the illness\n\nhowever the subjects in the piece i think would disagree that psychosis is an illness at all while i dont completely distrust the idea that maybe theres a better way to treat psychotic individuals than just medicating them into a stupor im hesitant when reading this and how exactly these people and groups are going about it  a couple of quotes that to me seems awfully dangerous and makes me think its only a matter of time until something truly tragic or dangerous happens in these support homes that have no clinical support\n\nmazelcarlton takes care not to diminish the suffering of people like herself and speaks of expanding “the options for healing” yet she sees her wish as analogous to not just the mainstreaming of autism but the nascent acceptance of new forms of gender identity “our society needs to expand its view of what it means to be human” she says “to expand what is affirmed and honored”\n\nthe people who stay at afiya are in dire need many are not only in mental disarray but also homeless many are suicidal there are no clinicians on staff no security personnel only people who know such desperation firsthand in the living room a homemade banner declares “holding multiple truths knowing that everyone has their own accurate view of the way things are”\n\nguests he explained are free to come and go at any hour then he shared “i feel like i want to die every day it’s one of the first things i think about when i wake up that is normal for me many people act like it isn’t normal here we have people express that they want to harm someone these are all normal thoughts but people train themselves to believe that they’re not giving space to express these things to have these conversations that’s the healing thing that’s the magic here when we don’t allow that space things get bigger”\n\nfor mazelcarlton one of the groups’ most essential tenets is that there must be no disabusing anyone of a personal reality unlike on a psych ward or in many a psychiatrist’s office unusual beliefs are not monitored corrected constrained mazelcarlton’s motto is “if i’m controlling i’m not connecting” — and connection for her is everything it defines hope","created":"2022-05-19

degree they have today we have not made similar investments in psychiatry for example i recently did a medicine consult on a patient who was having difficulty getting steady dosing on clozapine clozapine is probably the most effective antipsychotic we have but its use has been limited by its sideeffect profile including usual things like weight gain and elevated cholesterol but also has the rare but serious sideeffect of severely low white blood cell counts it turns out that weve discovered at least  years ago that the serum ratio of clozapine and its norclozapine metabolite helps determine things if your ratio is too low its less likely to be effective if its too high its more likely youll have metabolic sideeffects but theres a sweet spot at about  cloznorcloz weve known this

in the times about mental health in particular a group called hearing voices network and a home called afiya the piece explores the history of treating psychosis and similar mental diseases and how there is now a growing movement to stop medicating psychotic individuals questioning its efficacy in treating the illness\n\nhowever the subjects in the piece i think would disagree that psychosis is an illness at all while i dont completely distrust the idea that maybe theres a better way to treat psychotic individuals than just medicating them into a stupor im hesitant when reading this and how exactly these people and groups are going about it  a couple of quotes that to me seems awfully dangerous and makes me think its only a matter of time until something truly tragic or dangerous happens in these support homes that have no clinical support\n\nmazelcarlton takes care not to diminish the suffering of people like herself and speaks of expanding “the options for healing” yet she sees her wish as analogous to not just the mainstreaming of autism but the nascent acceptance of new forms of gender identity “our society needs to expand its view of what it means to be human” she says “to expand what is affirmed and honored”\n\nthe people who stay at afiya are in dire need many are not only in mental disarray but also homeless many are suicidal there are no clinicians on staff no security personnel only people who know such desperation firsthand in the living room a homemade banner declares “holding multiple truths knowing that everyone has their own accurate view of the way things are”\n\nguests he explained are free to come and go at any hour then he shared “i feel like i want to die every day it’s one of the first things i think about when i wake up that is normal for me many people act like it isn’t normal here we have people express that they want to harm someone these are all normal thoughts but people train themselves to believe that they’re not giving space to express these things to have these conversations that’s the healing thing that’s the magic here when we don’t allow that space things get bigger”\n\nfor mazelcarlton one of the groups’ most essential tenets is that there must be no disabusing anyone of a personal reality unlike on a psych ward or in many a psychiatrist’s office unusual beliefs are not monitored corrected constrained mazelcarlton’s motto is “if i’m controlling i’m not connecting” — and connection for her is everything it defines hope","created":"2022-05-19

movement is that filling a room with talk of phantasms will not infuse them with more vivid life or grant them more unshakable power instead partly by lifting the pressure of secrecy and diminishing the feeling of deviance the talk will loosen the hold of hallucinations and crucially the grip of isolation\n\nthis seems obvious to me and im curious that the article presents it as at odds with traditional treatment albeit without outright saying so that strikes me as designed to create an illusion of conflict where none or possibly very little actually exists my spouse is a mental health practitioner who has treated patients with auditory and visual hallucinations and shes never described that maintaining secrecy of hallucinations at least with trusted people is recommended practice\n\npsychiatry’s problematic drugs the who maintains must no longer be an unquestioned mainstay\n\nthis also strikes me as misleading the paragraph and the article switch quickly between mental health and psychiatry without explaining or even acknowledging the differences between those terms a person who is seeing a psychiatrist has almost surely already seen an lpc lcsw psychologist or similar probably more than one who has tried nonpharmacological evidencebased treatments such as cbt act dbt etc those are the first line of attack in the mental health field pharmacology dominates the field of psychiatry specifically because psychiatrists and im including nonmds like psychiatric nurse practitioners here as the only ones who can prescribe are the last resort when other

all these symptoms on selfcare article also trashes psych research without really appreciating where the field is going and the lack of investment in treating psychiatric illness","created":"2022-05-19

in the times about mental health in particular a group called hearing voices network and a home called afiya the piece explores the history of treating psychosis and similar mental diseases and how there is now a growing movement to stop medicating psychotic individuals questioning its efficacy in treating the illness\n\nhowever the subjects in the piece i think would disagree that psychosis is an illness at all while i dont completely distrust the idea that maybe theres a better way to treat psychotic individuals than just medicating them into a stupor im hesitant when reading this and how exactly these people and groups are going about it  a couple of quotes that to me seems awfully dangerous and makes me think its only a matter of time until something truly tragic or dangerous happens in these support homes that have no clinical support\n\nmazelcarlton takes care not to diminish the suffering of people like herself and speaks of expanding “the options for healing” yet she sees her wish as analogous to not just the mainstreaming of autism but the nascent acceptance of new forms of gender identity “our society needs to expand its view of what it means to be human” she says “to expand what is affirmed and honored”\n\nthe people who stay at afiya are in dire need many are not only in mental disarray but also homeless many are suicidal there are no clinicians on staff no security personnel only people who know such desperation firsthand in the living room a homemade banner declares “holding multiple truths knowing that everyone has their own accurate view of the way things are”\n\nguests he explained are free to come and go at any hour then he shared “i feel like i want to die every day it’s one of the first things i think about when i wake up that is normal for me many people act like it isn’t normal here we have people express that they want to harm someone these are all normal thoughts but people train themselves to believe that they’re not giving space to express these things to have these conversations that’s the healing thing that’s the magic here when we don’t allow that space things get bigger”\n\nfor mazelcarlton one of the groups’ most essential tenets is that there must be no disabusing anyone of a personal reality unlike on a psych ward or in many a psychiatrist’s office unusual beliefs are not monitored corrected constrained mazelcarlton’s motto is “if i’m controlling i’m not connecting” — and connection for her is everything it defines hope","created":"2022-05-19

movement is that filling a room with talk of phantasms will not infuse them with more vivid life or grant them more unshakable power instead partly by lifting the pressure of secrecy and diminishing the feeling of deviance the talk will loosen the hold of hallucinations and crucially the grip of isolation\n\nthis seems obvious to me and im curious that the article presents it as at odds with traditional treatment albeit without outright saying so that strikes me as designed to create an illusion of conflict where none or possibly very little actually exists my spouse is a mental health practitioner who has treated patients with auditory and visual hallucinations and shes never described that maintaining secrecy of hallucinations at least with trusted people is recommended practice\n\npsychiatry’s problematic drugs the who maintains must no longer be an unquestioned mainstay\n\nthis also strikes me as misleading the paragraph and the article switch quickly between mental health and psychiatry without explaining or even acknowledging the differences between those terms a person who is seeing a psychiatrist has almost surely already seen an lpc lcsw psychologist or similar probably more than one who has tried nonpharmacological evidencebased treatments such as cbt act dbt etc those are the first line of attack in the mental health field pharmacology dominates the field of psychiatry specifically because psychiatrists and im including nonmds like psychiatric nurse practitioners here as the only ones who can prescribe are the last resort when other treatments have failed\n\nwhile overall i really appreciate a lot of the stories the article tells the rhetorical framing as a highbrow variant of psychiatrists hate this one weird trick does readers
